## 1. Introduction

Urban areas across Europe are increasingly challenged by the impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss and the demand for sustainable development [@Nijkamp_Karima_2013]. As climate change is expected to become more extreme and social inequality in urban facilities continues to rise rise, solutions which address biodiversity loss, climate change and the degradation of quality of life in urban public spaces are urgently needed [@Ourloglou_et_al_2020] [@United_Nations_2025].

According to @Diaz_et_al_2019, in cities the impact of urbanization and intensified land use on fresh-water ecosystems is especially severe. Extreme biodiversity loss, water quality degradation, urban build-up, destruction of riparian buffers and the chanelisation of streams are some among many drastic changes that urban streams have gone through in the past centuries. In light of the challenges that urban areas are facing, urban stream restoration is seen as having an increasingly important role in the mitigation of climate change by buffering extreme temperatures and managing floods. Streams in urban areas also offer great opportunities for improved biodiversity and quality of life in urban spaces [@Diaz_et_al_2019].

In this context, spatial analytics can play a crucial role in informing decision-making and urban planning strategies [@Hurlimann_March_2012]. Through methods such as Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA) and typology construction, planners, designers and decision-makers can identify key problem areas which require targeted interventions.

The ReBioClim project, funded by the Interreg Central Europe Program [@rebioclim2024_TUDresden], focuses on revitalizing small urban streams to address biodiversity, climate adaptation and quality of life challenges facing urban areas in Central Europe [@rebioclim2024_Leibniz]. Running from June 2024 to January 2027, the project addresses the challenges of urban stream restoration in four Central European cities: Dresden, Jablonec nad Nisou, Poznan and Senica. The case study area of this report is the Bílá Nisa stream in Jablonec nad Nisou.

```

Bílá Nisa has two contrasting sides. In the inner city it is heavily built-up and urbanized, used for a variety of functions such as recreation, sports and industrial functions. At the same time, outside of the city borders the stream is quaint, quiet and natural. Accross its route, the stream is dealing with challenges of ecological degradation due to past industrial activities, groundwater flooding concerns and stakeholder conflicts.

The objective of this report is to quantitatively assess the current state of different parts of Bílá Nisa and identify areas with the highest potential for improvement for biodiversity, climate adaptation and quality of life. Through these efforts, the aim is to provide a better understanding of where and how to restore the waterways and create green-blue corridors that offer cooling effects, improve air quality, and provide recreational spaces for residents.

The identified challenges and objectives are translated into a main research question:

> *How can an integrated urban stream restoration project in Jablonec nad Nisou balance diverse stakeholder interests by identifying areas where improvement in biodiversity, flood risk reduction, and improvements in quality of life can take place?*

The main research question is then further divided per theme of biodiversity, climate adaptation and quality of life:

> *Biodiversity: Where can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?*

> *Climate Adaptation: Where along the stream can flood mitigation measures take place?*

> *Quality of Life: Which areas along the stream need improvements for quality of life to address stakeholder conflicts?*

## 2. Methodology

Methodological decisions such as the spatial scale, unit configuration, and data resolution directly influences the insights that can be drawn from the spatial analysis results [@Dungan_et_al_2002]. The description of methodology makes it possible to reproduce the conducted analysis and provides critical context for interpreting results. The decisions made for the analysis methodology are structured around principles derived from literature, geographical context and data availability.

### 2.a. Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA)

S-MCDA is an analytical process which specifically considers numerous objectives and criteria. It aggregates diverse data types and conflicting perspectives into synthetic results which can be used for a structured decision-making process. In the case of this report, the objectives are ecological improvement, flood protection and balancing stakeholder interests (see previous chapter). The specific criteria are named in Chapter 3: Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis.

### 2.b. Typology Construction (K-Means Clustering)

After conducting S-MCDA, the next step is to conduct a typology construction. This analysis looks at the different attributes of urban spaces and identifies spatial patterns and group them. This makes it possible to quantitatively compare the performance of different typologies to formulate different design intervention recommendations. For this report, the typology construction utilizes K-means cluster analysis, which identifies clusters by minimizing the sum of distances between the data points and their respective centroids (cluster centers).

### 2.c. Definition of Spatial Units

To conduct a meaningful spatial analysis, the study area must be divided into standardized spatial units. The unit is used for consistency in the assignment of spatial indicators. It also facilitates the aggregation and comparison of data across the urban landscape. For example, studies on urban heat island and green infrastructure use a regular grid of 50 x 50 meter cells as the base unit of analysis [@Bartesaghi-Koc_Osmond_Peters_2020]. Alternatively, @Burdziej_2019 uses a hexagonal grid where each hexagon has a side length of 100 m, selected based on the size of the study area (Toruń, Poland) and the intended spatial resolution of the study.

The definition of the spatial units was decided based on the size of Jablonec nad Nisou and the Bílá Nisa stream. A 100-meter radius buffer around the stream was selected, over which a grid of 100x100 meters was overlayed. This proved to be a good level of detail for the spatial analysis of the stream in the rural areas, while also being compatible with the available spatial raster data for the area. However, in the urban area of Jablonec and Nisou, the variation in spatial features and characteristics is significantly higher than in the outskirts of the city. The 100x100 meter grid would average out most values to an extent that the analysis would not show meaningful results. In addition, the urban stream restoration project requires the attention to be focused within the city, not in its outskirts.

To make sure that sufficient level of detail and attention is given to the urban area of Jablonec nad Nisou, and that the entire stream is still analyzed, the choice was made for the grid to be further divided into 50x50 meters inside the Jablonec and Nisou city borders. The higher level of detail provides more accuracy in the higher level of variation in spatial characteristics in the city compared to the rural area. The choice in different grid cell sizes means that only certain analysis methods (namely density, percentage) can be used to preserve standardization and comparability between different cells.

100 meters is a common grid cell size used in the spatial analysis of general environmental conditions, as can be seen in reports on mitigating heat stress [@Wang_et_al_2022], land use, population, economic [@Paprotny_Mengel_2022] and urban heat islands [@Lauwaet_et_al_2023] analysis. Meanwhile a raster size of 50 meters is more useful in analysis where spatial conditions, characteristics and typo-morphologies are examined, along with their influence on environmental conditions (see reports: @Chen_et_al_2023 ; @Song_et_al_2020 ; @Wong_et_al_2012).

![*Spatial Unit Definition.*](Inserted_images/General%20Images/Spatial%20Unit%20Definition-01.png){fig-align="center" width="750"}

### 2.d. Resolution and Data Acquisition Method

The spatial analysis uses secondary data retrieved mostly from Czech governmental agencies and organizations, as well as Geofabrik and the European Space Agency (the source is specified for each map further in the report). The limited availability of data resulted in the need to consider data of varying resolution levels and types (vector and raster). The resolution of spatial data is directly tied to the data acquisition method [@Bartesaghi-Koc_Osmond_Peters_2020].

For indicators such as air pollution, the measurement method (space-borne remote sensing) is better suited for large-scale urban assessments, the limited data availability resulted in the need to use data that may lack the spatial precision needed for detailed micro-climatic or ecological studies. On the other hand, data on biodiversity and quality of life is generally more well-documented, detailed and accessible. In these cases, a higher resolution is possible for the analysis.

The conducted analysis reflects this variation, using satellite data for broader patterns such as LST and impervious surfaces. This data is then supplemented with higher-resolution sources for space syntax calculations, biotope values and ecologically valuable habitats, to name a few.

The selected criteria for each respective goals can be found in the figures below.

})

# Render the carousel with settings
slickR(obj = img_tags) + 
  settings(dots = TRUE, infinite = TRUE, autoplay = TRUE)

```

### 2.e. Normalization

The data used in this study comes from many different sources and uses different units, as discussed above. Therefore, for the spatial data to be comparable, all values need to be brought to the same scale and unit of measurement (i.e. normalized). In these conditions the data values can be combined and compared to provide meaningful results and form typology clusters.

Due to the varying data types and resolutions, different methods for normalization are used. Each spatial dataset uses its own way of normalizing respective to the data type, acquisition and availability. Each method is explained in the following sections under their respective topic and/or map that they relate to.

## 3. Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA)

The S-MCDA utilizes various criteria and sub-questions to answer the research questions:

> *Biodiversity: Where can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?*
>
> *Climate Adaptation: Where along the stream can flood mitigation measures take place?*
>
> *Quality of Life: Which areas along the stream need improvements for quality of life to address stakeholder conflicts?*

The choice of criteria are based on scientific research, as well as data availability for Jablonec nad Nisou. For each criterion, a chosen dataset is analysed, treated and normalized to make them comparable.

For each theme, the criteria are weighed based on their relative importance for the research question utilizing the Saaty matrix (also known as the analytic hierarchy process). @FuzzyAHP was used for the construction of the Saaty matrix. The normalized values of all criteria in a given theme are aggregated and then combined to get concluding maps which identify key areas for potential design intervention. Maps showing the untreated data which was used for the conducted analysis can be found in the appendix.

### 3.A. Biodiversity

The research area is currently dealing with challenges of ecological degradation due to past industrial activities. Therefore the biodiversity analysis aims to follow the following question:

> *Where can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?*

The following figure shows the criteria for each biodiversity sub-question, along with the weight of each attribute. The weights of the attributes are combined to see the weight of each sub-question, and the weight of each value all adds up to one. It is important to note that the values for weighed road segment length and proportion of built-up area had to be inverted for the aggregation. Differently from other biodiversity criteria, these attributes are undesirable. Therefore a higher proportion of built-up area and weighed road segment length would result in a poor score.

![Aggregated Biodiversity Criteria.](Inserted_images/General%20Images/Aggregated%20Biodiversity%20Criteria-01.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Which Areas Have High Biodiversity Value?

Areas with an already high value for biodiversity are vital to preserve. It is much harder to restore biodiversity to its original levels than it is to preserve it. Therefore it is vital to keep track of areas valuable for biodiversity, and avoid influencing them with human activity. In addition, the existing biodiverse areas can act as building blocks for the expansion of the green network, and can be further improved through targeted design interventions.

***Floodplain Biotope Value***

The purpose of this criteria is to identify which Bílá Nisa floodplains serve as natural habitats and support local biodiversity. This criterion uses the 'Categorization of Floodplains' layer taken from the Agency for Nature and Landscape Conservation of the Czech Republic. The layer was developed as a practical decision-making tool to aid for the protection of significant landscape elements in the country by identifying their characteristics and value [@AOPK_CR_2022]. Since the layer source does not clearly state the methodology of determining the floodplain biotope value, this criterion is given relatively low weight.

The layer shows that most of the Bílá Nisa floodplain has negligible biotope value. However, some patches of moderate value remain which could be salvaged. To normalize this information, the polygons with moderate biotope value were isolated and 'intersected' according to the grid lines. Then an 'overlap analysis' was conducted to calculate the percentage of area per cell that has moderate floodplain biotope value.

***Diversity of Natural Habitats***

Habitat diversity enables interaction, support and exchange of materials and energy between different habitat types, which improves local biodiversity and resilience [@Alsterberg_et_al_2017]. Habitat diversity is highly important for the overall biodiversity and ecosystem stability, therefore it is a criteria that has significant weight.

The diversity of natural habitats criterion examines the basic habitat mapping of the stream area retrieved from the Agency for Nature and Landscape Conservation of the Czech Republic [@AOPK_CR_2025a]. This dataset maps the distribution of habitat types in the form of biomes. The detailed biomes are classified according to the Biotope Catalogue of The Czech Republic and include biomes which are influenced by human activity [@AOPK_CR_2010].

For the analysis of the diversity of natural habitats, anthropogenic biomes (coded as X) were excluded from the dataset, as those are generally less threatened and less biodiverse than their natural counterparts in urbanized areas [@Pekin_Pijanowski_2012]. The original data map shows the detailed natural habitats along Bila Nisa which are less than 50% anthropogenic.

To normalize the data, these natural habitat polygons were split up based on the grid lines using the 'intersection' function, and then each polygon was converted into a centroid. Afterwards, the 'join attributes by location (summary)' function was used to identify the number of unique habitat values in each cell. To address the difference in cell size between inside and outside city borders, for each cell the number of unique values were divided by the surface area of the grid cell. The resulting values were divided by the largest value (6) to get a normalized value from 0 to 1.

The map shows that there the largest diversity of natural habitats is right at the edges of the city borders.

***Proportion of Natural Habitat Area***

The surface area of natural habitats directly influences biodiversity and ecosystem health (@Ye_et_al_2025). Therefore it is important to identify areas which have the highest proportion of natural habitat area in a given site.

This criterion looks at the same data as the diversity of natural habitats, categorized in broader natural habitat types [@AOPK_CR_2025a]. The map shows a prominence of grasslands outside of the city, but there are also forests, shrubs and peat bogs. The polygons of these natural habitats were divided based on grid lines using the 'intersection' tool, and then an 'overlap analysis' was conducted to identify the cover area of these combined natural habitats in each cell. The map shows that most of the natural habitats area actually concentrated further away from the stream.

| Normalized Value | **\<0.4** | 0.4-0.6 | \>0.6 | Normalized Range (0-1) |

***Areas With High Biodiversity Value***

The three criteria for the sub-question are aggregated based on their weights and combined into an intermediate map which shows areas along the stream with high biodiversity value. Loučná nad Nisou, Hraničná and Tovární are the areas with the highest biodiversity value along Bílá Nisa.

![*Combination Map Biodiversity Question 1: Areas With High Biodiversity Value.*](Inserted_images/Biodiversity/Biodiversity%20Question%201.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Which Areas Have a High Level of Human Activity?

The presence of human activity is generally harms biodiversity, generally in the form of habitat destruction and lifestyle disturbance. Therefore areas where human activity is high may not be very effective locations to improve biodiversity.

This question has low weight compared to other questions. While a high level of human activity is undesirable for a biodiverse area, by all means it should not discourage efforts in trying to improve the ecological quality of a given location. The attributes considered in this question will be inverted for the final aggregation.

***Weighed Road Segment Length***

Roads act as physical barriers for wildlife, deterring animals from crossing, thereby fragmenting ecosystems, limiting migration and making them less resilient. Furthermore, even slow traffic roads increase the threat of bugs or animals being hit or run over by a car. Meanwhile diffuse pollution from tyre particles, gas leaks and window cleaning fluids threaten the health of ecosystems [@Marcantionio_et_al_2013].

Therefore, this criterion looks at the existing road infrastructure and its speed limits, aiming to grasp the level of harm that vehicles and road infrastructure may cause to the biodiversity. The criterion looks at data of road length per cell, as well as its speed limit to estimate the impact that the roads would have on biodiversity in a given cell.

The road infrastructure was taken from OpenStreetMap and clipped to the grid [@roads_OSM]. The road segments were then 'intersected' according to the grid lines. The length of each road segment was multiplied by its speed limit to adjust for the impact that vehicle speeds would have on the biodiversity. Each line segment was then converted into a centroid, and the 'join attributes by location (summary)' function was used to find the sum of all of the given values within a cell. Then the data was normalized by dividing all values by the highest value. It is important to note that for the later aggregation, the values in this criterion had to be inverted, as a larger presence of roads is undesirable for biodiversity.

:::

***Proportion of Built-up Area***

Urbanization intensity negatively influences local biodiversity both directly and indirectly [@Liu_Liu_wu_2025]. Proportion of built-up area gives a clue of how intensely various parts of the study area are urbanized.

The build-up area criterion utilizes the data on existing buildings from @Buildings_OSM to estimate the level of human activity in each cell. The 'intersection' function in QGIS split up the building polygons according to the grid lines. Afterwards, an 'overlap analysis' was conducted to calculate the percentage of area that is built-up within a given cell. In essence, the build-up area normalized value looks at the Floor Space Index (FSI) of each cell.

The results of the normalized data on build-up area show that there is some level of build-up along most parts of the stream. There is a fairly high variation of build-up area along the stream in the inner city. For the later aggregation, the values in this criterion had to be inverted, as it is undesirable for biodiversity to have a high level of build-up.

*Normalized Proportion of Built-up Area Table*

:::

![*Proportion of Built-up Area (normalized data).*](Inserted_images/Biodiversity/Built-up%20area%20(normalized%20data).png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

***Areas With High Level of Human Activity***

The two criteria for the sub-question are aggregated based on their weights and combined into an intermediate map which shows areas along the stream with a high level of human activity. Industrial areas generally seem to have the highest level of human activity, namely the Janovská industrial site and the industrial area near Mšeno nad Nisou, along with the village of Janov nad Nisou.

![*Combination Map Biodiversity Question 2: Areas With High Level of Human Activity.*](Inserted_images/Biodiversity/Biodiversity%20Question%202.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Which Areas Provide Opportunity for Improved Biodiversity?

Areas with certain existing spatial conditions may be easier to transform for improved biodiversity than others. Identifying these areas mean identifying locations which have the highest potential for improvement with minimum effort.

***Ecological Corridors***

Ecological corridors criterion looks at the defined ecological corridors to identify opportunities to not only improve the local biodiversity, but enhance the ecological network on the local, regional and inter-regional scale.

The data used for this criterion is the 'Methodologically Unified Definition of The Territorial System of Ecological Stability' from the Agency for Nature and Landscape Conservation of the Czech Republic [@AOPK_CR_2025d]. The dataset methodologically determined all hierarchial levels and types of territories which are vital for ecological stability.

To normalize this data, the layer polygons were split up per cell using the 'intersect' function, and the 'overlap analysis' was conducted to identify the percentage of area per cell that is taken up by the ecological corridor polygon. In the resulting map (where 1 is 100% of the area and 0 is 0% of the area) key cells for ecological connectivity can be seen.

:::

![*Ecological Corridors (normalized data).*](Inserted_images/Biodiversity/Ecological%20corridors%20(normalized%20data).png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

***Potential for Natural Floodplain Restoration***

For the natural floodplain restoration potential criterion, the 'Categorization of Floodplains' layer of the Agency for Nature and Landscape Conservation of the Czech Republic is used. As previously mentioned, the layer was developed as a practical decision-making tool to aid for the protection of significant landscape elements in the country by identifying their characteristics and value. Unfortunately, the source does not explicitly state the methodology of how these potentials were determined [@AOPK_CR_2022].

To normalize this data, the polygons with medium and high potential for restoration were isolated. Since there are not many areas with floodplain restoration potential, and there is only one comparatively small patch of medium restoration potential, both medium and high potentials were considered as equal. The polygons were 'intersected' according to the grid lines, and then 'overlay analysis' was conducted to find the percentage of area with natural floodplain restoration for each cell. In the resulting map, key areas with higher potential for floodplain restoration can be seen both within and outside the city borders. As it is unclear what methodology was used to identify the potential, the weight of this criteria is moderate.

***Zones of Protected Natural Areas***

Legal protection for natural areas is vital to limit human activity which may negatively influence biodiversity. However, establishing protected areas are often insufficient in preventing biodiversity loss. Therefore, the zones of protected natural areas are considered in this analysis but are given limited weight [@Hein_Cunha_deFrancisco_2024].

Zones of protection of natural areas examine the level of legal protection which large-scale specially protected natural areas have. The zoning data was taken from Agency for Nature and Landscape Conservation of the Czech Republic [@AOPK_CR_2025b] [@AOPK_CR_2025c]. The dataset shows that there are some areas along the stream with Zone III and Zone IV levels of protection. Zone IV indicates a landscape management zone with the least strict protection, allowing for broader human activity, but still focusing on the preservation of ecological value. Zone III is a natural buffer zone where traditional and sustainable land use is still generally allowed. The map shows that mostly only the areas outside of the city borders have some level of protection.

To process the data, the polygons were 'intercepted' based on the grid lines, then the 'overlap analysis' function calculated the percentage of area different protection zones took up in each grid cell. Using the field calculator, the majority (\>50%) value in each cell size was identified and normalized. In case there was no majority, the average between two values with the highest percentage of area was taken. For example, if a cell was 45% zone III and 35% zone IV, then the final cell value is 0.5, because zone VI has the normalized value of 0.25 and zone III has the normalized value of 0.75.

***Areas With Biodiversity Improvement Opportunities***

The three criteria for the sub-question are aggregated based on their weights and combined into an intermediate map which shows areas along the stream with a potential for improved biodiversity. Compared to the other research sub-questions, areas with biodiversity opportunities have a more localized distribution. Key areas with biodiversity opportunities are the Loučná nad Nisou village, as well as the greenfield site near Hraničná. In the inner city, areas which offer biodiversity opportunities are: U Hřiště bridge, the industrial area near Mšeno nad Nisou and Tovární.

![*Combination Map Biodiversity Question 3: Areas With Biodiversity Improvement Opportunities.*](Inserted_images/Biodiversity/Biodiversity%20Question%203.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Biodiversity S-MCDA Aggregation & Conclusion

Having conducted the detailed analysis, all criteria values from the biodiversity are weighed and combined into a single concluding map:

![*Concluding Biodiversity Map.*](Inserted_images/Biodiversity/Final%20Biodiversity%20Map.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

The concluding map offers insight to the initial biodiverisity research question: *where can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?*

In general, areas where ecological quality of the stream can be improved are situated outside of the most urbanized areas. Namely the area near Janovská highway, as well as the nearby village of Loučná nad Nisou seem to be the largest areas with the highest potential for ecological improvement. Inside the city of Jablonec nad Nisou, U Hřiště bridge and the industrial area near Mšeno nad Nisou offer the most potential for ecological improvement. Right at the city borders, areas of Hraničná and Tovární also offer possibilities for improved ecological quality.

### 3.B. Climate Adaptation

The research area is currently dealing with increasing climate risks, particularly flood hazards, due to urban development. Therefore, the climate adaptation analysis aims to address the following question:

> *Where along the stream can flood mitigation measures take place?*

This question is further divided into the following questions:

> *Which Areas Have Highest Flood Damage Risk?*

> *Which Areas Have The Most Impervious Surfaces?*

> *Which Areas Have Healthy Vegetation?*

The figure below shows the criteria for each climate adaptation sub-question, along with the corresponding weights of each attribute. These weights are combined to determine the influence of each sub-question on the final result, with the total sum equal to one.

By aggregating these criteria, the analysis helps to spatially identify priority areas along the Bílá Nisa stream where climate adaptation measures such as flood management should be prioritized.

![*Aggregated Climate Adaptation Criteria.*](Inserted_images/General%20Images/Aggregated%20Climate%20Adaptation%20Criteria-01.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Which Areas Have Highest Flood Damage Risk?

Flood risk is one of the most urgent challenges in stream corridor management, especially in areas with extensive urbanization and altered natural floodplains. By locating these high-risk zones, planners can prioritize where flood mitigation strategies should be implemented first.

***Flood Impact Zones in Floodplains***

Floodplains are flat, low-lying areas near a river or coast that are likely to flood due to rainfall, tidal surges or other storm events. The type of landscaping in a floodplain can also reflect the level of flood impact risk. For example, a flood in an urbanized residential area will sustain much more damage compared to a flood in a natural area. The data used of this analysis comes from @AOPK_CR_2022.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Flood Impact Zones in Floodplains Normalisation Table"}
| Indicator | Low Flood Risk (0) | Middle Flood Risk (0.5) | High Flood Risk (1) | Normalized Range (0-1) |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Landscape Type | Natural forest / wetland | Arable land / grassland | Built-up / paved surfaces | 0 – 1 |
:::

![*Flood Impact Zones in Floodplains (normalized map).*](Inserted_images/Climate%20Adaptation/floodplain%20map-01.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Which Areas Have The Most Impervious Surfaces?

A high proportion of impervious surfaces can directly lead to floods in urban areas, and contribute to the Urban Heat Island effect. Impervious surfaces directly affect the area's ability to absorb water, while higher night land surface temperatures typically indicate denser built environments with less green cover.

***Mean Impervious Surface Percentage***

Impervious surfaces prevent water infiltration and increase runoff and heat accumulation. High imperviousness is typically associated with poor ecological performance and higher flood/heat risks. For this reason we chose to following ranges when normalizing.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title = "Impervious Surface Normalisation Table"} *Normalized Impervious Table*

| Indicator | Low Risk Threshold (0) | High Risk Threshold (1) | Normalized Range (0–1) | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Impervious Surface (%) | 0% | 80% | 0 – 1 | \>80% often found in dense urban areas, 0% = natural cover. Therefore we normalise between this range. |

:::

![*Mean Impervious Surface Percentage (Normalized Map).*](Inserted_images/Climate%20Adaptation/Normalised_Mean_Impervious_v2.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

***Mean Night-Time Land Surface Temperature (LST)***

High night-time temperatures indicate poor cooling and urban heat retention. The Mean Night-Time Land Surface Temperature (LST) was collected from the Terra & Aqua satellite from NASA. The temporal range of when the data collected was the average LST from the summer of 2022 (june to august), this range was taken due to data availability. This data was chosen as the resolution was the highest at 1 by 1 km. Risk increases with rising LST, especially during summer heatwaves. The following table below shows the range of data collected compared to the normalized range.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Night Time Land Surface Temperature Normalisation Table"}
*Normalized Mean LST table*

| Indicator | Low Risk Threshold (0) | High Risk Threshold (1) | Normalized Range (0–1) | Notes |

| Mean Night-Time LST (°C) | 11°C | 16°C | 0 – 1 | 30°C = common threshold for urban heat stress at night, we chose to normalise for our range. Given Jablonec is at altitude, the temperature is going to be lower. |
:::

![*Mean Night-Time Land Surface Temperature (Normalized Map).*](Inserted_images/Climate%20Adaptation/Normalised_Mean_LST_v2.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Which Areas Have Healthy Vegetation?

Areas with higher NDVI values suggest healthier and denser vegetation, which can contribute to climate resilience by reducing surface runoff and moderating urban heat effects.

***Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)***

NDVI indicates vegetation health and coverage. The NDVI was collected from the Sentinel-2 satellite using bands 2, 3 and 8. Then the mean NDVI was computed based on a temporal range of the last 5 years(between 01-01-2020 and 01-01-2025), the resolution of final NDVI is 10 by 10m. Higher values correspond to greener, more vegetated areas, contributing to cooling and ecosystem benefits. An NDVI of \>0.6 is typical of healthy vegetation in temperate zones [@ozyavuz2015determination]. For this reason the following table shows our justified choice of NDVI range when normalizing.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Normalised Difference Vegetation Index Normalisation Table"}

:::

![*Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Normalized Map).*](Inserted_images/Climate%20Adaptation/Normalised_Mean_NDVI_v2.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Climate Adaptation S-MCDA Aggregation & Conclusion

According to the criteria of the S-MCDA analysis, a concluding map was created to highlight areas along the Bílá Nisa Stream with lower overall adaptive capacity to climate change, where flood mitigation measures should take place.

All normalized data were extracted from the attribute tables and transferred into an Excel file, where weighted normalized values were calculated based on the criteria weights defined in the S-MCDA framework. These weighted values were then aggregated to produce a composite dataset reflecting the spatial distribution of flood risk. Notably, the NDVI values were inverted to align with the direction of other criteria — so that higher final scores indicate weaker flood resilience.

The resulting dataset was exported as a CSV file and linked to the grid layer in QGIS to visualize the spatial outcomes.The final concluding map is presented underneath

![Concluding climate adaptation S-MCDA Map](Inserted_images/Climate%20Adaptation/con%20climate%20map-01.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

The final conclusding map reveals that two industrial sites along the stream exhibit particularly low adaptive capacity to flood risk, suggesting a pressing need for the implementation of resilience-based flood mitigation measures. Additionally, a sports field with impervious surfaces located between these two industrial areas was also identified as an area requiring improvement in surface permeability to enhance its flood adaptation performance.

### 3.C. Quality of life

For quality of life, can vary from psychological and health indicators to more tangible urban climate indicator. @Murgas_Klobucnik_2016 used the gold standard for assessing quality of life in municipalities in the Czech Republic. The following indicators are included in the Gold standard for measuring the quality of life in urban environments.

> Wanting to live — can be expressed by the absence of the will to live, i.e., suicide. Expression of the indicator is suicide mortality rate.

> Long life—can be expressed by the indicator of life expectancy.

> Living in a complete family can be expressed by its absence; indicator is divorce rate. - Having children—can be expressed by the indicator of birth rate.

> Being healthy—can be expressed by the absence of health; indicator is mortality.

> Living in a healthy environment—can be expressed by the environmental pollution.

> Being educated—can be expressed by the indicator of the share of university graduates.

> Having a job—can be expressed by the indicator of unemployment rate.

> Being a good person—can be expressed by the indicator of generativity.

Since many data are statistical data that have not been translated to vector layers, different indicators have been created which could give an idea of the quality of life. @Doi_Kii_Nakanishi_2008 discovered that accessiblity to basic human needs is an important factor for improving quality of life through policy implementation and spatial planning for land use purposes or transportation infrastructure. Moreover, @Khalil_2012 pointed out that economic viability of urban areas and the various of economic activity forms also an important indicator for quality of life and the functioning of urban systems.

Based on these 3 research papers, three different perspectives for measuring quality of life surrounding the area of the Bila Nisa urban stream have been picked; amenities around the stream, accessiblity of the stream, and the condition of the urban climate. Based on the assingment to enhance the quality of life along the stream, one main research question and three sub research questions have been drafted to pin point the areas along the Bila Nisa that underperform and require an intervention that enhances the quality of life along the urban stream according to the directions of the ReBioClim program.

> *Which areas along the stream need improvements for quality of life to address stakeholder conflicts?*

This question is further divided into the following questions:

> *Which Areas Are Deprived of Public Facilities?*

> *Which Areas Lack Infrastructure to Access?*

> *Which Areas Can Be Physically Uncomfortable?*

![*Aggregated Quality of Life Criteria.*](Inserted_images/General%20Images/Aggregated%20Quality%20of%20Life%20Criteria-01.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

For the first analysis, we look at the availability of public amenities such as green spaces and public goods that are available to the population along the Bila Nisa, that could support urban life and enhance quality of life. The Bila Nisa is known for its offering of leisure activities and greenery, however these areas are not connected, thus for a larger population perceived as inaccessible.

#### Which Areas Are Deprived of Public Facilities?

Public amenities are essential for urban life. Basic access to public goods such as parcs and stores offer incentives to go out, socialize and improve the general well-being of the population. Therefore, mapping which areas have these amenities and highlighting the areas that are deprived and require better access for the sake of the population. For the availability of public amenities along the stream, we looked at the availability of public green and the presence and diversity of public areas.

***Access to Public Green Space***

Accessiblity to nature and public green offer comfort in urban areas and is an important factor to be taken into account to determine if areas are liveable. As stated in the case of ReBioClim, ecological quality of the stream has been degregated over the years through human and industrial activity, resulting in a less liveable urban environment. There are some public green areas along the stream mainly located on the outskirts of the urban area. The data used is derived from Open Street Map services [@Green_space_OSM].

A clip mask has been made to overlay it on the grid layer using the mean values. The area of public green per grid cell is then normalized on a 0 to 1 scale using the formula underneath.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
**Normalized value** = *("area mean" - min("area mean")) / (max("area mean") - min("area mean"))*
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

:::

Following the conversion to normalized values using the open field calculator tool in GIS, the layer has been styled using an equal interval of 5 classes.

![Normalized map of public green availability along Bila Nisa](Inserted_images/Quality%20of%20Life/Bila%20Nisa%20Jablonec%20-%20Access%20public%20green%20along%20stream%20normalized.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

***Access to Public Amenities***

Public amenities are needed to facilitate urban life and provide the population with basic human needs. Having these amenities close to the urban stream forms an important indicator how liveable the environment around the Bila Nisa is. Using the land use and point of interest layers from Open Street Map services, a clip layer has been made of all the public amenities and areas surrounding the Bila Nisa [@PoI_OSM].

The layer filters out only public areas that are also considered meeting places for social gathering and have a positive effect on the well-being of the population. Based on these public amenities, data is normalized based on the diversity of public amenities, which indicates which area offer more public amenities and are considered more key to social life for the population of Jablonec nad Nisau.

The data is normalized using the layer count data, on a scale from 0 to 1. The formula underneath has been used in the open field calculator tool to create a new column with normalized values.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
**Normalized value** = *("type count" - min("type count")) / (max("type count") - min("type count"))*

|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Type count | \<2 | \>5 | \<2 → 0-0.2 (low availability), \>5 → 0.8-1 (high availability) |
:::

Using 5 classes, the layer is styled using an equal interval of 0.2. It shows two areas with high diversity, namely in the south at the end of the stream where different modes of infrastructure are located and more central near the Mšeno nad Nisou industrial area.

![*Normalized map diversity of public amenities along Bila Nisa.*](Inserted_images/Quality%20of%20Life/Bila%20Nisa%20Jablonec%20-%20Diversity%20public%20areas%20normalized.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

Combining these two layers using the criteria weights in the S-MCDA, two areas stand out due to the combination of public greenery and the diversity of amenities, which are the areas Tovarní-Síroka and Hraničná.

![*Combined normalized layers availability of public goods.*](Inserted_images/Quality%20of%20Life/AVAILABILITY%20PUBLIC%20GOODS.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Which Areas Lack Infrastructure to Access?

The second indicator for quality of life is the accessibility of the stream. The stream offers apart from a livable climate due to the cooling effect of the river also a social haven for the population of Jablonec nad Nisau, offering several meeting spots in the leisure areas along the stream. Accessiblity to the stream as a cool area and social hotspot is therefore an important indicator for quality of life as it has positive inclination on physical and mental well-being of the population. Accessiblity of the urban stream is analyzed through the existing road network and the public transport infrastructure.

***Access to Stream*** How well the urban stream can be accessed can be analyzed through the level of integration of the existing road network to determine centralities along the Bila Nisa. For this analysis, the road network of Jablonec nad Nisau is extracted from Open Street Map services [@Roads_OSM] and a space syntax analysis is conducted using Angular Integration to determine how central areas are. A clip mask focusing on the areas close to the Bila Nisa is made and overlayed on the grid.

Using the open field calculator, a new column is created for normalizing the data to a 0 to 1 scale using the following formula:

::: {.callout_note collapse="true"}
**Normalized value** = *("sum_Atw2kM" - minimum("sum_Atw2kM")) / (maximum("sum_Atw2kM") - minimum("sum_Atw2kM"))*
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
*Normalized Road Integration Table*

| Variable | Low Integration(0) | High Integration (1) | Notes |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Angular Integration Sum 2k | \<41.25 | \>115.25 | \<41.25 → 0-0.25 (low integration), \>115.25 → 0.75-1 (high integration) |
:::

Categorizing the layer with the newly calculated normalized column, the following map shows how urban centers North, central and South-west of the stream can be defined.

![*Normalized map showing accessiblity to urban stream.*](Inserted_images/Quality%20of%20Life/Bila%20Nisa%20Jablonec%20-%20Access%20to%20stream%20normalized.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

***Access to Public Transport*** Apart from the road network, which primarily focusses on private mobility, public transport offers a good indication how the stream can be accessed from a more regional point of view. For this, a data layer from the ArcGIS web [@PT_Jablonec_nad_Nisou_2025] is found that represents the public transport network of Jablonec nad Nisau. A clip from this layer is made, which results in a couple of bus stops and a tram stops that fall within reach of the stream. To see how accessible the stream is from public transportation, service areas are used with a radius of 500m (bus stops) and 1000m (tram stops) based on the type of connection. Bus is more urban while the tram has a regional connection with the neighboring city of Liberec [@public_transport_Jablonec_nad_Nisau].

Based on the number of opportunities, which is based on how many service areas overlap, the data can be normalized. A separate column is created using the open field calculator tool using the following formula to normalize the data from a 0 to 1 scale, based on the range of opportunities.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Public transport access normalisation equation"}
**Normalized value** = *("layer count" - min("layer count")) / (max("layer count") - min("layer count"))*
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Normalized Public transport proximity Table"}

| Variable | Low Access(0) | High Access (1) | Notes |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Layer Count | =0 | \>4 | \<1 → 0-0.2 (low access), \>4 → 1 (high access) |
:::

This results in the following map underneath, where areas in more urban areas in the south and on crossroads over better accessiblity to public transport.

![*Access to public transport near the stream normalilzed.*](Inserted_images/Quality%20of%20Life/Bila%20Nisa%20Jablonec%20-%20Access%20public%20transport%20along%20stream%20normalized.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

Overlaying these two layers, one can see a couple urban centers popping up. Especially in the south which is a more urban area and offer different modes of transport and regional connections. Furthermore, there is one main road along the stream connecting the city of Jablonec nad Nisau with rural villages like Loucná nad Nisau. However, the map shows that more central areas with leisure are not well connected.

![*Combined accessibility map.*](Inserted_images/Quality%20of%20Life/ACCESSIBLITY%20TO%20STREAM.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Which Areas Can Be Physically Uncomfortable?

The last performance indicator for quality of life relates to physical condition of the urban environment, in other words to figure out how healthy the urban environment around the Bila Nisa is. This is relevant for the case of Jablonec nad Nisau since the area was once a breeding ground for industrial activity, especially for glass and glass ornament production [@Brittanica_2011].

***Air Pollution***

To ensure comparability across pollutants, all air quality indicators were normalized to a common scale between 0 and 1. The normalization is based on internationally recognized health guidelines from the World Health Organization [@who2021] and the European Union (Directive 2008/50/EC) [@eu_air_quality]. For PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, and NO₂, thresholds were defined using three reference points: half the WHO annual guideline value (representing minimal health risk), the WHO annual guideline value (health-based target), and the EU legal limit (regulatory maximum). For SO₂, BaP, and BzN, thresholds were determined using available EU targets or inspired by the Belgian national limits [@irceline2022]. All values were normalized using the upper bound of each category range to reflect worst case exposure levels for each grid cell. This approach allows consistent interpretation of long-term exposure risks across pollutants.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Initial Air Pollution Normalisation Method"}
*Normalized Pollution table*

| Pollutant | WHO 2021 Guideline (µg/m³) | EU Limit (µg/m³) | Low Risk Threshold (0) = ½ WHO | High Risk Threshold (1) = EU | Normalized Range (0–1) |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| PM2.5 | 5 | 20 | 2.5 | 20 | 0 – 1 |
| PM10 | 15 | 40 | 7.5 | 40 | 0 – 1 |
| NO₂ | 10 | 40 | 5 | 40 | 0 – 1 |
| BaP | *0.12 (indicative, EU)* | 1.0 | 0.06 | 1.0 | 0 – 1 |
| BzN | 0.2 *(WHO guideline)* | 1.0 *(assumed)* | 0.1 | 1.0 | 0 – 1 |
| SO₂ | 40 *(WHO 24h guideline)* | 125 *(EU 24h)* | 20 | 125 | 0 – 1 |
:::

A then example calculation in Qgis for SO2 would be:

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Calculation Example for SO2"}
*Example calculation for SO2*

CASE WHEN "MAX_majority" IS NULL THEN NULL WHEN "MAX_majority" \< 20 THEN 0 WHEN "MAX_majority" \> 125 THEN 1 ELSE ("MAX_majority" - 20) / (125 - 20) END
:::

However, as was later discovered, this approach led to all of the pollution data being qualified as 0. Given the Czech data is categorized differently and is given as aggregated annual values, a choice was made to use the same range given with the data (and its associated colours) when normalizing. Given that our analysis is context specific, changing the normalization will highlight the range in air quality within our given site. Whether the air quality is below or above the recommended values will no longer become the basis.

This simpler method yields the final table with the new normalization based on the input data classification is the following.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="New Normalisation Method for Pollution"}
*New Normalized Pollution Table*

| Pollutant | Observed Max (From Layer) | Low Risk Threshold (0) | High Risk Threshold (1) | Normalization Formula |

***Percentage of Tree Cover***

Tree cover density represents the percentage of land surface covered by trees within our chosen area of interest. This measure is normalized on a 0 to 1 scale, where 0 corresponds to \<25% tree cover and 1 corresponds to \>75% tree cover. This range was chose as lower tree cover densities (\<0.25) are linked to increased land surface temperatures and higher urban heat island effects, while higher densities (\>0.75) are associated with reduced temperatures and mitigation of urban heat [@morabito2021surface].

Combining these two layers results in the following combined map. The map shows the more urban one goes, the less liveable the urban climate becomes. Some areas score low because they are former and current industrial areas, for example Hranicá and Janovska industrial areas were pollution is still present.

![*Urban life conditions along the Stream (Normalized Map).*](Inserted_images/Quality%20of%20Life/URBAN%20LIFE%20CONDITIONS.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Quality of Life S-MCDA Aggregation & Conclusion

Using the criteria of the S-MCDA analysis, a combined map is created to highlight which areas along the Bila Nisa stream perform less on quality of life, and suggest an intervention is required to enhance quality of life performance along the urban stream.

All the normalized data is extracted from the attribute table and transferred to an Excel file to calculate the normalized values against the criteria weights from the S-MCDA. All the weighted values are combine in order to create and prepare the aggregated data set for quality of life. Only for the criteria air pollution, the data is inverted as a higher score, means higher the air pollution, which is a negative indicator for urban life condition. The data is then exported as a CSV file in QGIS and the aggregated values are joined in the combined grid layer. The final combined map is presented underneath.

![*Combined & Weighed Quality of Life Map.*](Inserted_images/Bila%20Nisa%20Jablonec%20-%20Combined%20Quality%20of%20Life.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

The combined map shows that more remote areas along main roads Tovarní-Síroka and in the village Loucná nad Nisau, and former industrial areas Hranicná, Janovska, and Mseno nad Nisau show lower quality of life performance. The more remote areas should improve public amenities while the industrial areas need more ecological improvement.

### 3.D. S-MCDA Conclusion

Having conducted S-MCDA , it is now possible to answer the main research questions:

> *Biodiversity: Where can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?*

Ecological quality along the stream can mainly be improved in the outskirts and outside of the city. However, some locations in the inner city, such as the area near U Hřiště bridge and Tovární.

> *Climate Adaptation: Where along the stream can flood mitigation measures take place?*

Flood mitigation measures can be implemented mainly in the inner city, particularly in the industrial area near Mšeno nad Nisou and the sports field near U Hřiště bridge.

> *Quality of Life: Which areas along the stream need improvements for quality of life to address stakeholder conflicts?*

For this question, the research looked at areas which are lacking social infrastructure and accessibility for a good quality of life. Therefore areas which are in need of improvements are those which are currently performing poorly. Quality of life differs somewhat evenly across the entire length of the stream. There is not a significant difference between the inner city and its outskirts. Inside the city, key areas which are in need of quality of life improvements are Tovární - Siroká, the industrial area near Mšeno nad Nisou and the Janovská industrial area.

## 4. Typology Construction

Our approach to out topology construction is embedded in our main reserach questions and goals. Based on our analysis we formulated the following guiding question for finding relevant typologies in Jablonec nad Nisou.

### 4.a. Research Question & Variables

*"What spatial typologies emerge from key ecological and accessibility indicators along the stream corridor, and how can they inform targeted green-blue infrastructure interventions?"*

This question is grounded in the broader ambition to enhance ecosystem services, urban climate resilience, and quality of life through the strategic planning of nature-based solutions. To approach this, we identified from all of our indicators, 4 main key spatial indicators that reflect the functionality of green-blue spaces. Each indicator was selected to represent a dimension of performance relevant to our project:

**Proportion of Natural Habitat (Biodiversity):** A higher share of natural habitat suggests greater ecological quality and potential for species support and connectivity.

**Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Climate Adaptation)**: NDVI serves as a proxy for vegetative health and biomass, contributing to climate regulation, shading, and evapotranspiration.

**Flood Impact Zones in Floodplains (Climate Adaptation):** Areas exposed to flood risk offer opportunities for flood-resilient design, such as for example wetland restoration or floodable parks.

**Access to Stream (Quality of Life):** Stream accessibility reflects the potential for recreation, well-being, and nature connection for residents, which at the moment due to stakeholder conflicts may be lacking.

By combining these indicators, we aim to capture both the ecological aspects and human functionality of areas along the stream. This will enable us to cluster similar grid cells into meaningful typologies relevant to our research. We believe that the typologies will support decision making for where to preserver, intervene or enhance the multifunctional green-blue spaces along the Bila Nisa stream.

### 4.b. Methodology

**Step 1: Data Preparation and Normalization**

To begin, we extracted the four selected indicators from our spatial dataset and removed the geometry to focus on their numerical values. Since K-means is sensitive to scale, we standardized the data using z-score normalization. This rescales each variable so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, ensuring that all variables contribute equally to the clustering.

#head(X_scaled)

##########################################################
#Calculate Inertia and Elbow
##########################################################


# Initialize an empty numeric vector to store inertia values 
inertia <- numeric()

# Try k values from 2 to 9
k_values <- 2:9

# Loop through each k value (here we can also add silhouette)
for (k in k_values) {
  km <- kmeans(X_scaled, centers = k, nstart = 50) 
  
  # tot.withinss is Total within-cluster sum of squares
  # This measures how compact the clusters are: lower is better.
  inertia <- c(inertia, km$tot.withinss)
}

# Combine the results into a data frame for plotting
elbow_df <- data.frame(k = k_values, inertia = inertia)

#print(elbow_df)

```

**Step 2: Choosing the Number of Clusters (Elbow Method)**

The K-means algorithm requires specifying the number of clusters k. To find a suitable value, we used the **elbow method**, which involves:

1.  Running K-means for a range of k values (2 to 9).

2.  Calculating inertia for each value — the total within-cluster sum of squares. Lower inertia means tighter, more compact clusters.

We then plotted the inertia values to identify the "elbow point", where the reduction in inertia begins to level off.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
##########################################################
# Plot the elbow -> we will choose 5 clusters
##########################################################

# Make the elbow plot
plot(k_values, inertia,
     type = "b",                  # shown both points + lines 
     col = "darkblue",
     main = "Elbow Method")


```

Based on the elbow plot, we choose `k = 5` as a good number of clusters.

**Step 3: Running the K-means Algorithm**

Based on `step 2`, we set a fixed seed to ensure reproducibility and ran the K-means algorithm using k = 5. Each grid cell was assigned a cluster label. This will then allow us to perform the next step, where we can visualize the clusters in their respective grid cells.

**Step 4: Visualizing Clusters**

As mentioned, now that we have performed the K means clustering with a value of 5, we can explored the distribution of clusters both spatially and in feature space.

1.  2D Map: Shows how clusters are arranged geographically.

2.  3D Plot: Visualizes how clusters are separated in terms of indicator values (3 axes: NDVI, natural habitat, access).

We chose these 3 axis after trial and error with the fourth indicator (Flood Impact Zones). The combination below resulted in a better visual of how the clusters formed.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

set.seed(0)  # The number 0 is just a fixed choice. You can also use 10, 345, etc.

# Choose the number of clusters based on the elbow plot
k <- 5
kmeans_result <- kmeans(X_scaled, centers = k, nstart = 20)
grids$cluster <- as.factor(kmeans_result$cluster) # The result kmeans_result$cluster is a list of cluster labels (1 to 4), in the same order as the original rows in X_scaled and grids

     col = plot_colors,
     main = "Spatial Pattern of Urban Stream Clusters", 
     border = NA)

       legend = paste("Cluster", names(cluster_colors)), 
       fill = cluster_colors, 
       title = "Clusters",
       bty = "n",
       cex = 0.8)

      yaxis = list(title = "NDVI (Greenness)"),
      zaxis = list(title = "Access to Stream")
    )
  )

```

**Step 5: Understanding Cluster Profiles (Radar Charts)**

To interpret the clusters, we examined the cluster centers, which represent the "average" values of each indicator per cluster.

We converted the standardized cluster centers back to the original scale to understand their real-world meaning and visualized them using radar charts, highlighting each cluster's performance across the four indicators.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

##########################################################
# Create Radar Charts for the 5 Typologies
##########################################################

# Install and load necessary packages
if (!require("fmsb")) install.packages("fmsb")
library(fmsb)

# Get the cluster centers (in standardized form)
scaled_centers <- kmeans_result$centers

# Print them
#print("Cluster centers (standardized):")
#print(scaled_centers)

# Convert the centers back to original scale: x * SD + mean
original_centers <- t(apply(
  scaled_centers, 1, 
  function(x) x * attr(X_scaled, "scaled:scale") + attr(X_scaled, "scaled:center")
))

# Print the real-world values
#print("Cluster centers (original):")
#print(original_centers)


# Get the cluster center for each row, using the cluster assignment
centroids_matrix <- kmeans_result$centers[kmeans_result$cluster, ]

# Calculate Euclidean distance between each point and its assigned cluster center
grid_distances <- sqrt(rowSums((X_scaled - centroids_matrix)^2))

# Save to grids
grids$cluster_dist <- grid_distances


# Prepare the data for radar chart
radar_data <- as.data.frame(original_centers)

# Add column names (simplified without spaces to avoid issues)
colnames(radar_data) <- c("Flood_Zone", "NDVI", "Stream_Access", "Natural_Habitat")

# To use fmsb, we need to add max and min of each variable to the dataframe
max_min <- data.frame(
  Flood_Zone = c(max(radar_data$Flood_Zone), min(radar_data$Flood_Zone)),
  NDVI = c(max(radar_data$NDVI), min(radar_data$NDVI)),
  Stream_Access = c(max(radar_data$Stream_Access), min(radar_data$Stream_Access)),
  Natural_Habitat = c(max(radar_data$Natural_Habitat), min(radar_data$Natural_Habitat))
)

rownames(max_min) <- c("Max", "Min")

# Combine the max_min with the data
radar_data <- rbind(max_min, radar_data)

# Set colors for each cluster
colors_radar <- cluster_colors


# Set graphic parameters
op <- par(mar = c(2, 2, 4, 2),  # Bottom, Left, Top, Right margins
          cex.main = 1.5)        # Larger title font size

# Create the radar chart
radarchart(
  radar_data,
  axistype = 1,
  seg = 3,
  title = "All Clusters Comparison",
  pcol = colors_radar,
  plwd = 2,
  plty = 1,
  cglcol = "grey",
  cglty = 1,
  axislabcol = "grey",
  caxislabels = seq(min(radar_data[2,]), max(radar_data[1,]), length.out = 4),
  cglwd = 0.8,
  vlcex = 1, 
  calcex = 0.5
)


legend(
  "topright",
  legend = paste("Cluster", 1:k),
  bty = "n",
  pch = 20,
  col = colors_radar,
  text.col = "black",
  cex = 1,  
  pt.cex = 2
)

# Reset graphical parameters
par(op)

```

**Step 6: Assessing Cluster Confidence (Distance to Cluster Center)**

We calculated the Euclidean distance from each grid cell to its assigned cluster center in feature space. This indicates how representative a cell is of its cluster: smaller distances imply stronger conformity.

This was visualized using histograms, one per cluster.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

##########################################################
# Compute distance to cluster center
##########################################################


# Histogram with density curve
ggplot(grids, aes(x = cluster_dist, fill = cluster)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.6, bins = 30, position = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~cluster) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cluster_colors) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Distance to Cluster Centers by Cluster",
    x = "Euclidean Distance (standardized feature space)",
    y = "Count"
  )

#st_write(grids, "data/clustered_tiles_with_distances.gpkg", delete_dsn = TRUE)

#print(grid_distances)
```

### 4.c. Results

**Typology description**

The result of performing K-means clustering to derive typologies is the translation from statistical output into actionable insights. For this reason, we have tried to describe the formed clusters appropriately based on their characteristics, theory and literature to guide intervention planning.

::: {style="font-size: 0.85em"}
| Type (Cluster) | Natural Habitat | NDVI | Flood Zone | Stream Access | Description |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 1 (Red) | **High** | **High** | Low | Low | This cluster represents areas with lush, **biodiverse vegetation and high ecological quality.** These zones have low flood risk but are relatively inaccessible to the public. Their primary value lies in their ecological function. |
| 2 (Orange) | Low | Moderate | Moderate | **High** | High-access area with limited vegetation or habitat. Here there is potential for **urban greening or recreational upgrades.** Their moderate flood risk indicates a need for **climate adaptation strategies.** |
| 3 (Yellow) | Low | Low | Moderate | Low | This typology consists of degraded areas with limited vegetation, biodiversity, and accessibility.This is suitable for **buffer zones or low-impact enhancement.** |
| 4 (Green) | **High** | Low | Low | Low | Although these areas are classified as having **high natural habitat**, they exhibit **low vegetation health or cover**. Stream access is also limited. This could indicate sparse but valuable habitats. |
| 5 (Blue) | **High** | Low | **High** | Low | Flood-exposed, degraded zone. Here we can prioritize **wetland restoration or flood-resilient interventions.** |

## 5. Discussion

The methodology used in this analysis combines multiple spatial vector and raster datasets and a structured decision-making approach (S-MCDA) to support urban and environmental planning. This process allowed for an assessment by including both environmental and social indicators.

*Data Availability.* While some datasets, like biodiversity, provided detailed information, others, such as air quality, were more general. The difference in level of detail are not ideal for this kind of analysis, as it may distort the results by missing important local spatial conditions. Unfortunately due to limited data availability, the analysis had to utilize a variety of data types with varying levels of detail.

*100 meter buffer limitation.* The choice of a 100-meter buffer around the Bílá Nisa stream focused on the study area and excluded any information outside of it. This may have left out some important factors just outside of the buffer zone, thus reducing the accuracy of the results. A larger or adjustable buffer could have added more important context, but it would also variability and make it harder to ensure that data is comparable.

*Varying grid size*. One key aspect of the methodology was the use of different grid cell sizes 50x50 meters in urban areas and 100x100 meters in rural areas. This approach helped to show more detail in the urban environments, where it is needed. However, using two different grid sizes also introduced some challenges and limitations. The difference in cell sizes restricted the possible spatial analysis methods to calculating density and percentage of cover area. While accounting for the differing grid cell sizes, the selected methods of analysis may have still skewed the results, as 100x100 meter cells averaged out differing values on a larger scale than the 50x50 meter cells. This made it harder to compare certain results across the whole study area.

*Grid positioning.* The positioning of the grid itself also played a role in the final results. Even small changes in where the grid is placed can affect the outcome, as the grid isolates whole spatial units from each other based on the grid lines. It is possible that if the grid was overlayed with a different reference point, the results would identify different problem areas. Therefore, placement still matters and should be considered when interpreting the results.

*Static information*. The analysis was based on static data, meaning it represents conditions at one point in time. However, urban and environmental factors often change with years and seasons, as the area develops and the climate conditions change. A key limitation of this research is that it does not account for this possible variability. For example, the accessibility to the stream may be drastically different in the summer and winter. This variation is especially important to consider for planning resilient, flexible and long-lasting stream restoration projects.

*Typology Construction* Another important observation relates to the interpretation of typologies based on the K-means clustering approach. The nearest grid cell to the cluster center in feature space, which we often use as an illustrative example of a "typical" cell, may not necessarily be representational of the spatial or contextual characteristics of the entire typology in reality. This is exhibited when visualizing our 5 nearest grid cells respective to their cluster centers. Some appear wuite similar and the size and shape of the spatial unit may lead to unrealistic representation of the cluster. The local variations, edge effects, and mixed land uses can cause certain grid cells to exhibit high conformity in indicator values while not fully reflecting on-the-ground conditions (small patches of high NDVI in otherwise built up areas). This means that while the clustering helps identify patterns and priority areas, local field verification and expertise remains essential before planning interventions. Additionally, the typology maps, while helpful for visualizing patterns, should be used in conjunction with stakeholder input to interpret what the clusters mean in practice, especially in areas where social conflicts over stream access may exist.

Furthermore, the selection of four key indicators, while aligned with the project's goals, inherently leaves out other dimensions such as soil quality, microclimate, and informal community uses that may affect the success of interventions. Future work could explore adding more dynamic or seasonal variables or using ensemble clustering methods to test the stability of typologies under varying indicators.

### Group Reflection

During this project the challenge at first was navigating the many websites and applications. Starting by searching for vector data and trying to divide the three main subjects over all the group members. Navigating Rstudio was a real challenge and managing the push and pull requests which took us some getting used to. But after the midterm we really picked up the pace and finished the k-means clustering and gave a nice presentation. The thing that we could have done better is communication. What went well was the use of the Miroboard which gave a nice overview during the project.

## 6. Conclusion

The analysis of the Bílá Nisa stream using Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA) and typology construction visualized places where interventions are necessary along the stream in Jablonec nad Nisou. The findings show that different parts of the stream area vary significantly in terms of biodiversity value, climate vulnerability, and quality of life indicators.

The inner-city sections of the stream present the greatest need for intervention. These areas are heavily urbanized, with limited vegetation, poor access to the stream and have degraded environmental conditions. At the same time, they offer high potential for integrated improvements in biodiversity, climate adaptation, and public well-being. Targeted actions in these zones such as adding green-blue infrastructure, restoring ecological connections, and improving accessibility could create meaningful benefits for both people and nature.

On the other hand, areas in the north of Jablonec nad Nisou which have high ecological value and lower human pressure, should be primarily preserved and improved without disturbing existing natural functions. These zones play an important role in maintaining biodiversity and supporting long-term ecological stability.

While the typology construction and clustering provided actionable insights, it is important to emphasize that these are analytical abstractions that should be interpreted with care. The clusters represent simplifications of complex socio-ecological realities, and the identified priority zones are starting points for planning rather than definitive boundaries for interventions. The methodology offers a replicable workflow for other urban streams, but it should be paired with other forms of validation and assessment. Such an approach would strengthen our research and approach towards the ReBioClim case study while recognizing the limitations of spatial clustering for typology construction in heterogeneous urban landscapes.

In summary, the combination S-MCDA and k-means clustering. The results introduce another facet from which local authorities, urban designers, and environmental planners can be guided in developing actions that balance ecological needs with urban development. This work contributes to the goals of the ReBioClim framework by highlighting where multifunctional green-blue infrastructure can improve biodiversity, climate adaptation and quality of life in the city.
