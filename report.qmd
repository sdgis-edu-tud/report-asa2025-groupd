## Introduction

Urban areas across Europe are increasingly challenged by the impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss, and the demand for sustainable development [@nijkamp2013new]. According to [@article], in cities the impact of land use on fresh-water ecosystems is especially severe. As climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, solutions to combat these effects are urgently needed [@ourloglou2020assessing].

A good solution is through urban streams. Urban streams are expected to have an important role in the mitigation of climate change by buffering extreme temperatures and prevent floods. More importantly, finding nature-based solutions are key and can restore existing strained water systems [@ourloglou2020assessing]. In this context, spatial analytics can play a crucial role in informing climate adaptation and urban planning strategies [@hurlimann2012role]. Through methods such as Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA) and typology development, planners and designers can better understand urban systems, evaluate trade-offs, and propose the correct targeted interventions.

The ReBioClim project, funded by the Interreg Central Europe Program [@rebioclim2024], exemplifies this approach by focusing on revitalizing small urban streams. It additionally provides a framework where nature-based solutions can be identified to enhance biodiversity, mitigate climate change effects, and improve urban living conditions [@rebioclim_ioer2024]. Running from June 2024 to January 2027, the project addresses the challenges of urban stream restoration in four Central European cities, including Jablonec nad Nisou, the case targeted in this report.

![ReBioClim Project Overview](Inserted_images/rebioclim_currentstate.png){width="600"}

Over recent decades, Jablonec nad Nisou has experienced overbuilding, channelization, and neglect of its urban streams, leading to ecological degradation and reduced quality of life. Our objective is to quantitatively assess the current state of these waterways and identify areas with the highest potential for improvement. Through these efforts, we aim to provide a better understanding of where and how to restore the waterways and create green-blue corridors that offer cooling effects, improve air quality, and provide recreational spaces for residents.

```

Our research centers on the Bílá Nisa stream, and will address the problems we have identified through the lens fo the three following goals: Biodiversity, Climate Adaptation, and Quality of Life. These goals, relevant to our location has led to our main research question:

> *Where should urban stream restoration be prioritized in Jablonec nad Nisou to maximize biodiversity, climate adaptation, and quality of life?*

Our derived subquestions, respective to each goal are then the following:

> *Where can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?*

> *Which areas are the most in need for flood protection?Where can flood mitigation measures take place?*

> *Where can improvements in quality of life balance stakeholder interests in areas around the stream?*

//we will add how the report is structured here after.

## Methodology

A important foundation for applying spatial analytics in urban environments is in the careful definition of the area of interest (AOI) and the spatial units used for analysis. The decisions regarding spatial scale, unit configuration, and data resolution directly influences the insights that can be drawn from spatial data. [@dungan2002balanced] The justification of our area of interest and chosen spatial unit is structured around principles derived from literature, geographical context and data availability. Furthermore, in order to apply a S-MCDA normalized values at a comparable scale are needed, further emphasizing the importance of defining an appropriate spatial unit.

### Definition of Spatial Units

To conduct a meaningful spatial analysis, the study area must be divided into standardized spatial units. For example, urban heat island and green infrastructure studies have shown to use a regular grid of 50 x 50 meter cells as the base unit of analysis [@BARTESAGHIKOC2020103893]. On the other hand, [@burdziej2019using] uses a hexagonal grid where each hexagon has a side length of 100 m, selected based on the size of the study area (Toruń, Poland) and the intended spatial resolution of the study.

Therefore, based on the size of Jablonec nad Nisou and the Bila Nisa stream as well as the following discussed principles affecting the conducted analysis, a spatial unit grid of 100 x 100 meters was chosen. The unit is used for consistency in the assignment of spatial indicators and facilitates the aggregation and comparison of data across the urban stream landscape. The 100 x 100m spatial unit is specific to the scale Jablonec nad Nisou, the resolution of the data collected and relevant literature on stream assessments.

### Resolution and Data Acquisition Method

The resolution of spatial analysis is directly tied to the data acquisition method [@BARTESAGHIKOC2020103893]. While spaceborne remote sensing used for the measurement of some of our indicators when data availability was lacking is better suited for large-scale urban assessments, it often lacks the spatial precision needed for detailed micro climatic or ecological studies. On the other hand, biodiversity and quality of life data are generally acquired at larger scale and would require smaller spatial units. For example, the widely accepted walking range of 500 meters [@macioszek2022effect; @popp2004walking], or biodiversity connectivity of around 100m stretches, identified by [@RANTA2021106980]. Our method reflects this balance, using satellite data for broader patterns such as LST and impervious surfaces. We then supplement this with higher-resolution sources for space syntax calculations, biotope values and ecologically valuable habitats, to name a few. The collected data for each respective goals can be found in the figures below.

imgs <- c("Inserted_images/data_biodiversity.png",

slickR(imgs, height = 400, width = 700) +
  settings(dots = TRUE)

```

### Scale-Specific Indicators for Stream Assessment

Urban stream analysis requires scale-appropriate methodologies. Different ecosystem services or hydrological characteristics demand different spatial extents. [@RANTA2021106980] uses for example 100m stretches for biological assessments and 500m buffers for hydromorphilogical evaluations.

Therefore, when deciding on our scale, we considered our indicators and attempted to closely match them to retain a good representation of the spatial dynamics of the stream functions we aimed to analyze.

### Impact of Scale on Detectable Effects

The spatial resolution of the data we collected significantly shapes the analytical results. Averaging the data collected within the chosen 100 x 100m cells allows for generalized insights, which we found best fitting. It may however still obscure localized effects such as even smaller micro climatic benefits of tree clusters or linear vegetation elements. We chose the trade off that best fits our and balances detail with analytical feasibility.

// For the MCDA -\> add how we average and normalise values here?

### Normalization

The data used in this study comes from many different sources and uses different units as discussed above. Therefore, to compare them evenly, all values need to be brought to the same scale, and normalized in order to later conduct K-means clustering to discover appropriate typologies. We therefore could not use one method for all data normalization. Instead, each topic or data map uses its own way of normalizing respective to the data acquisition and availability. For climate adaptation, values like temperature and air pollution were compared to limits from the EU or WHO. For biodiversity, we used scales that show how suitable or rich an area is for nature. For quality of life, we used standards such as walking distances or access to green areas. Each method is explained in the following sections under their respective topic or map that they relate to.

### Climate Adaptation

### Biodiversity

### Quality of Life

#### Pollution Normalization

To ensure comparability across pollutants, all air quality indicators were normalized to a common scale between 0 and 1. The normalization is based on internationally recognized health guidelines from the World Health Organization [@who2021] and the European Union (Directive 2008/50/EC) [@eu_air_quality]. For PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, and NO₂, thresholds were defined using three reference points: half the WHO annual guideline value (representing minimal health risk), the WHO annual guideline value (health-based target), and the EU legal limit (regulatory maximum). For SO₂, BaP, and BzN, thresholds were determined using available EU targets or inspitred by the Belgian national limits [@irceline2022]. All values were normalized using the upper bound of each category range to reflect worst case exposure levels for each grid cell. This approach allows consistent interpretation of long-term exposure risks across pollutants, while aligning with current regulatory and scientific guidance.

| Pollutant | WHO 2021 Guideline (µg/m³) | EU Limit (µg/m³) | Low Risk Threshold (0) = ½ WHO | High Risk Threshold (1) = EU | Normalized Range (0–1) |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| PM2.5 | 5 | 20 | 2.5 | 20 | 0 – 1 |
| PM10 | 15 | 40 | 7.5 | 40 | 0 – 1 |
| NO₂ | 10 | 40 | 5 | 40 | 0 – 1 |
| BaP | *0.12 (indicative, EU)* | 1.0 | 0.06 | 1.0 | 0 – 1 |
| BzN | 0.2 *(WHO guideline)* | 1.0 *(assumed)* | 0.1 | 1.0 | 0 – 1 |
| SO₂ | 40 *(WHO 24h guideline)* | 125 *(EU 24h)* | 20 | 125 | 0 – 1 |

##### Quality of life

For quality of life, three main criteria have been developed according to the paper published by [@Khalil2017]: Availability of public amenities, accessibility of the area, and environmental indicators. Another indicator include socio-economic data on the population, however these have not been translated in vector data for the area of Jablonec nad Nisau and have therefore been excluded from this analysis.

For the first analysis, we look at the availability of essential public amenities like public functions and public green along the stream and how well accessible they are.

![Public amenities along Bila Nisa stream](http://rstudio-server-edu.bk.tudelft.nl:8787/files/report-asa2025-groupd/data_carpentry/fig_output/MAP%20-%20PUBLIC%20AMENITIES.png) ![Normalized map of public amenities](http://rstudio-server-edu.bk.tudelft.nl:8787/files/report-asa2025-groupd/data_carpentry/fig_output/Access%20public%20amenities%20along%20Bila%20Nisa.png) ![Map showing public green along Bila Nisa stream](http://rstudio-server-edu.bk.tudelft.nl:8787/files/report-asa2025-groupd/data_carpentry/fig_output/MAP%20-%20PUBLIC%20GREEN%20CLIP.png) ![Normalized map of public green availability along Bila Nisa](http://rstudio-server-edu.bk.tudelft.nl:8787/files/report-asa2025-groupd/data_carpentry/fig_output/Access%20to%20Public%20Green%20along%20Bila%20Nisa.png) Secondly, we analyzed how well the urban stream is connected to the urban area through the street network and availability of public transport.
