## This is a computational notebook

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

You can delete this entire callout between and including the lines

## Introduction

Urban areas across Europe are increasingly challenged by the impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss, and the demand for sustainable development [@nijkamp2013new]. According to [@article], in cities the impact of land use on fresh-water ecosystems is especially severe. As climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, solutions to combat these effects are urgently needed [@ourloglou2020assessing].

A good solution is through urban streams. Urban streams are expected to have an important role in the mitigation of climate change by buffering extreme temperatures and prevent floods. More importantly, finding nature-based solutions are key and can restore existing strained water systems [@ourloglou2020assessing]. In this context, spatial analytics can play a crucial role in informing climate adaptation and urban planning strategies [@hurlimann2012role]. Through methods such as Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA) and typology development, planners and designers can better understand urban systems, evaluate trade-offs, and propose the correct targeted interventions.

The ReBioClim project, a European initiativve funded by the Interreg Central Europe Program [@rebioclim2024], exemplifies this approach by focusing on revitalizing small urban streams. It additionally, uses nature-based solutions to enhance biodiversity, mitigate climate change effects, and improve urban living conditions [@rebioclim_ioer2024].Running from Juse 2204 to January 2027, the project addresses the challenges of urban stream restroration in four Central European cities, including Jablonec nad Nisou.

In this report, inspired by the ReBioClim project, we focus on the urban streams of Jablonec nad Nisou. Over recent decades, the city has experienced overbuilding, channelization, and neglect of its urban streams, leading to ecological degradation and reduced quality of life. Our objective is to quantitatively assess the current state of these waterways and identify areas with the highest potential for improvement. Through these efforts, we aim to provide a better understanding of where and how to restore the waterways and create green-blue corridors that offer cooling effects, improve air quality, and provide recreational spaces for residents.

Our research centers on the Bílá Nisa stream, and in order to address the problems we have identified three key themes relevant to our approach: Biodiversity, Climate Adaptation, and Quality of Life. These themes, relevant to our location has led to our main research question:

> *(Where should urban stream restoration be prioritized in Jablonec nad Nisou to maximize biodiversity, climate adaptation, and quality of life?)*

Our derived substations, respective to each theme are then the following:


> *(Where can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?)*

> *(Which areas are the most in need for flood protection?Where can flood mitigation measures take place?)*

> *(Where can improvements in quality of life balance stakeholder interests in areas around the stream?)*

//we will add how the report is structured here after. 

## Methods

When applying spatial analytics to a chosen site,

### Climate Adaptation

### Biodiversity

When considering the biodiversity we look at three key indicators: Green Network, Habitat type and Floodplains.

| Section | Division (e.g., function, service) | Indicator | Assessment Scale |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| UB – Macrophytes | EFH Habitat availability | Streambed sedimentation | 100 m |
| PS – Watersupply | Transversal connectivity | Groundwater recharge | 500 m |
| RS – Climateregulation | Air temperature variation |  | 100 m |
| RS – Pollination | Nectariferous plants |  | 500 m |
| CS – Education and cognitive development | Distance to urban stream from home |  | 200 m |

: (#tbl-scale-measurement) Examples of different scales of measurement, according to [@RANTA2021106980].

For air quality, relabeling the RGB values to legend.

| Green Band Value | SO₂ Range (µg/m³) | Color        | Class Label | Class Value |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 168              | 0.0 – 0.1         | Dark Green   | Very Good   | 0           |
| 201              | 0.1 – 0.2         | Light Green  | Good        | 1           |
| 237              | 0.2 – 0.5         | Yellow       | Moderate    | 2           |
| 204              | 0.5 – 1.0         | Light Orange | Poor        | 3           |
| 102              | 1.0 – 2.0         | Dark Orange  | Very Poor   | 4           |
| 0                | 2.0 – 5.0         | Red          | Hazardous   | 5           |
