    "text": "1. Introduction\nUrban areas across Europe are increasingly challenged by the impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss and the demand for sustainable development (Nijkamp, 2013). As climate change is expected to become more extreme and social inequality in urban facilities continues to rise rise, solutions which address biodiversity loss, climate change and the degradation of quality of life in urban public spaces are urgently needed (Ourloglou, 2020; United_Nations_2025?).\nAccording to Diaz (2019), in cities the impact of urbanization and intensified land use on fresh-water ecosystems is especially severe. Extreme biodiversity loss, water quality degradation, urban build-up, destruction of riparian buffers and the chanelisation of streams are some among many drastic changes that urban streams have gone through in the past centuries. In light of the challenges that urban areas are facing, urban stream restoration is seen as having an increasingly important role in the mitigation of climate change by buffering extreme temperatures and managing floods. Streams in urban areas also offer great opportunities for improved biodiversity and quality of life in urban spaces (Diaz, 2019).\nIn this context, spatial analytics can play a crucial role in informing decision-making and urban planning strategies (Hurlimann, 2012). Through methods such as Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA) and typology construction, planners, designers and decision-makers can identify key problem areas which require targeted interventions.\nThe ReBioClim project, funded by the Interreg Central Europe Program (Hydrobiology, 2024), focuses on revitalizing small urban streams to address biodiversity, climate adaptation and quality of life challenges facing urban areas in Central Europe (Ecological Urban & Development, 2024). Running from June 2024 to January 2027, the project addresses the challenges of urban stream restoration in four Central European cities: Dresden, Jablonec nad Nisou, Poznan and Senica. The case study area of this report is the Bílá Nisa stream in Jablonec nad Nisou.\n\n\n\nReBioClim Project Overview (Hydrobiology, 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJablonec nad Nisou and the Bila Nisa stream\n\n\nBílá Nisa has two contrasting sides. In the inner city it is heavily built-up and urbanized, used for a variety of functions such as recreation, sports and industrial functions. At the same time, outside of the city borders the stream is quaint, quiet and natural. Accross its route, the stream is dealing with challenges of ecological degradation due to past industrial activities, groundwater flooding concerns and stakeholder conflicts.\nThe objective of this report is to quantitatively assess the current state of different parts of Bílá Nisa and identify areas with the highest potential for improvement for biodiversity, climate adaptation and quality of life. Through these efforts, the aim is to provide a better understanding of where and how to restore the waterways and create green-blue corridors that offer cooling effects, improve air quality, and provide recreational spaces for residents.\nThe identified challenges and objectives are translated into a main research question:\n\nHow can an integrated urban stream restoration project in Jablonec nad Nisou balance diverse stakeholder interests by identifying areas where improvement in biodiversity, flood risk reduction, and improvements in quality of life can take place?\n\nThe main research question is then further divided per theme of biodiversity, climate adaptation and quality of life:\n\nBiodiversity: Where can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?\n\n\nClimate Adaptation: Where along the stream can flood mitigation measures take place?\n\n\nQuality of Life: Which areas along the stream need improvements for quality of life to address stakeholder conflicts?\n\n\n\n\nProject workflow chart."

    "section": "2. Methodology",
    "text": "2. Methodology\nMethodological decisions such as the spatial scale, unit configuration, and data resolution directly influences the insights that can be drawn from the spatial analysis results (Dungan, 2002). The description of methodology makes it possible to reproduce the conducted analysis and provides critical context for interpreting results. The decisions made for the analysis methodology are structured around principles derived from literature, geographical context and data availability.\n\n2.a. Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA)\nS-MCDA is an analytical process which specifically considers numerous objectives and criteria. It aggregates diverse data types and conflicting perspectives into synthetic results which can be used for a structured decision-making process. In the case of this report, the objectives are ecological improvement, flood protection and balancing stakeholder interests (see previous chapter). The specific criteria are named in Chapter 3: Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis.\n\n\n2.b. Typology Construction (K-Means Clustering)\nAfter conducting S-MCDA, the next step is to conduct a typology construction. This analysis looks at the different attributes of urban spaces and identifies spatial patterns and group them. This makes it possible to quantitatively compare the performance of different typologies to formulate different design intervention recommendations. For this report, the typology construction utilizes K-means cluster analysis, which identifies clusters by minimizing the sum of distances between the data points and their respective centroids (cluster centers).\n\n\n2.c. Definition of Spatial Units\nTo conduct a meaningful spatial analysis, the study area must be divided into standardized spatial units. The unit is used for consistency in the assignment of spatial indicators. It also facilitates the aggregation and comparison of data across the urban landscape. For example, studies on urban heat island and green infrastructure use a regular grid of 50 x 50 meter cells as the base unit of analysis (Bartesaghi-Koc, 2020). Alternatively, Burdziej (2019) uses a hexagonal grid where each hexagon has a side length of 100 m, selected based on the size of the study area (Toruń, Poland) and the intended spatial resolution of the study.\nThe definition of the spatial units was decided based on the size of Jablonec nad Nisou and the Bílá Nisa stream. A 100-meter radius buffer around the stream was selected, over which a grid of 100x100 meters was overlayed. This proved to be a good level of detail for the spatial analysis of the stream in the rural areas, while also being compatible with the available spatial raster data for the area. However, in the urban area of Jablonec and Nisou, the variation in spatial features and characteristics is significantly higher than in the outskirts of the city. The 100x100 meter grid would average out most values to an extent that the analysis would not show meaningful results. In addition, the urban stream restoration project requires the attention to be focused within the city, not in its outskirts.\nTo make sure that sufficient level of detail and attention is given to the urban area of Jablonec nad Nisou, and that the entire stream is still analyzed, the choice was made for the grid to be further divided into 50x50 meters inside the Jablonec and Nisou city borders. The higher level of detail provides more accuracy in the higher level of variation in spatial characteristics in the city compared to the rural area. The choice in different grid cell sizes means that only certain analysis methods (namely density, percentage) can be used to preserve standardization and comparability between different cells.\n100 meters is a common grid cell size used in the spatial analysis of general environmental conditions, as can be seen in reports on mitigating heat stress (Wang, 2022), land use, population, economic (Paprotny, 2022) and urban heat islands (Lauwaet, 2023) analysis. Meanwhile a raster size of 50 meters is more useful in analysis where spatial conditions, characteristics and typo-morphologies are examined, along with their influence on environmental conditions (see reports: Chen (2023) ; Song (2020) ; Wong (2012)).\n\n\n\nSpatial Unit Definition.\n\n\n\n\n2.d. Resolution and Data Acquisition Method\nThe spatial analysis uses secondary data retrieved mostly from Czech governmental agencies and organizations, as well as Geofabrik and the European Space Agency (the source is specified for each map further in the report). The limited availability of data resulted in the need to consider data of varying resolution levels and types (vector and raster). The resolution of spatial data is directly tied to the data acquisition method (Bartesaghi-Koc, 2020).\nFor indicators such as air pollution, the measurement method (space-borne remote sensing) is better suited for large-scale urban assessments, the limited data availability resulted in the need to use data that may lack the spatial precision needed for detailed micro-climatic or ecological studies. On the other hand, data on biodiversity and quality of life is generally more well-documented, detailed and accessible. In these cases, a higher resolution is possible for the analysis.\nThe conducted analysis reflects this variation, using satellite data for broader patterns such as LST and impervious surfaces. This data is then supplemented with higher-resolution sources for space syntax calculations, biotope values and ecologically valuable habitats, to name a few.\nThe selected criteria for each respective goals can be found in the figures below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.e. Normalization\nThe data used in this study comes from many different sources and uses different units, as discussed above. Therefore, for the spatial data to be comparable, all values need to be brought to the same scale and unit of measurement (i.e. normalized). In these conditions the data values can be combined and compared to provide meaningful results and form typology clusters.\nDue to the varying data types and resolutions, different methods for normalization are used. Each spatial dataset uses its own way of normalizing respective to the data type, acquisition and availability. Each method is explained in the following sections under their respective topic and/or map that they relate to."

    "section": "3. Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA)",
    "text": "3. Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA)\nThe S-MCDA utilizes various criteria and sub-questions to answer the research questions:\n\nBiodiversity: Where can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?\nClimate Adaptation: Where along the stream can flood mitigation measures take place?\nQuality of Life: Which areas along the stream need improvements for quality of life to address stakeholder conflicts?\n\nThe choice of criteria are based on scientific research, as well as data availability for Jablonec nad Nisou. For each criterion, a chosen dataset is analysed, treated and normalized to make them comparable.\nFor each theme, the criteria are weighed based on their relative importance for the research question utilizing the Saaty matrix (also known as the analytic hierarchy process). Olomouc (n.d.) was used for the construction of the Saaty matrix. The normalized values of all criteria in a given theme are aggregated and then combined to get concluding maps which identify key areas for potential design intervention. Maps showing the untreated data which was used for the conducted analysis can be found in the appendix.\n\n3.A. Biodiversity\nThe research area is currently dealing with challenges of ecological degradation due to past industrial activities. Therefore the biodiversity analysis aims to follow the following question:\n\nWhere can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?\n\nThe following figure shows the criteria for each biodiversity sub-question, along with the weight of each attribute. The weights of the attributes are combined to see the weight of each sub-question, and the weight of each value all adds up to one. It is important to note that the values for weighed road segment length and proportion of built-up area had to be inverted for the aggregation. Differently from other biodiversity criteria, these attributes are undesirable. Therefore a higher proportion of built-up area and weighed road segment length would result in a poor score.\n\n\n\nAggregated Biodiversity Criteria.\n\n\n\nWhich Areas Have High Biodiversity Value?\nAreas with an already high value for biodiversity are vital to preserve. It is much harder to restore biodiversity to its original levels than it is to preserve it. Therefore it is vital to keep track of areas valuable for biodiversity, and avoid influencing them with human activity. In addition, the existing biodiverse areas can act as building blocks for the expansion of the green network, and can be further improved through targeted design interventions.\n\n\n\nBiodiversity value (normalised data)\n\n\nFloodplain Biotope Value\nThe purpose of this criteria is to identify which Bílá Nisa floodplains serve as natural habitats and support local biodiversity. This criterion uses the ‘Categorization of Floodplains’ layer taken from the Agency for Nature and Landscape Conservation of the Czech Republic. The layer was developed as a practical decision-making tool to aid for the protection of significant landscape elements in the country by identifying their characteristics and value (České republiky, 2022). Since the layer source does not clearly state the methodology of determining the floodplain biotope value, this criterion is given relatively low weight.\nThe layer shows that most of the Bílá Nisa floodplain has negligible biotope value. However, some patches of moderate value remain which could be salvaged. To normalize this information, the polygons with moderate biotope value were isolated and ‘intersected’ according to the grid lines. Then an ‘overlap analysis’ was conducted to calculate the percentage of area per cell that has moderate floodplain biotope value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Floodplain Biotope Value Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Value\n&lt;0.3\n0.3-0.7\n&gt;0.7\nNormalized Range (0-1)\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nLow to No Presence\nSome Presence\nHigh Presence\nProportion of Moderately Valuable Floodplain Biotope per Cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFloodplain Biotope Value (normalized data).\n\n\nDiversity of Natural Habitats\nHabitat diversity enables interaction, support and exchange of materials and energy between different habitat types, which improves local biodiversity and resilience (Alsterberg, 2017). Habitat diversity is highly important for the overall biodiversity and ecosystem stability, therefore it is a criteria that has significant weight.\nThe diversity of natural habitats criterion examines the basic habitat mapping of the stream area retrieved from the Agency for Nature and Landscape Conservation of the Czech Republic (České republiky, 2025a). This dataset maps the distribution of habitat types in the form of biomes. The detailed biomes are classified according to the Biotope Catalogue of The Czech Republic and include biomes which are influenced by human activity (České republiky, 2010).\nFor the analysis of the diversity of natural habitats, anthropogenic biomes (coded as X) were excluded from the dataset, as those are generally less threatened and less biodiverse than their natural counterparts in urbanized areas (Pekin, 2012). The original data map shows the detailed natural habitats along Bila Nisa which are less than 50% anthropogenic.\nTo normalize the data, these natural habitat polygons were split up based on the grid lines using the ‘intersection’ function, and then each polygon was converted into a centroid. Afterwards, the ‘join attributes by location (summary)’ function was used to identify the number of unique habitat values in each cell. To address the difference in cell size between inside and outside city borders, for each cell the number of unique values were divided by the surface area of the grid cell. The resulting values were divided by the largest value (6) to get a normalized value from 0 to 1.\nThe map shows that there the largest diversity of natural habitats is right at the edges of the city borders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Diversity of Natural Habitats Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Value\n&lt;0.4\n0.4-0.6\n&gt;0.6\nNormalized Range (0-1)\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nLow to No Diversity\nSome Diversity\nHigh Diversity\nNumber of Unique Natural Habitats per Cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity of Natural Habitats (normalized data)\n\n\nProportion of Natural Habitat Area\nThe surface area of natural habitats directly influences biodiversity and ecosystem health (Ye (2025)). Therefore it is important to identify areas which have the highest proportion of natural habitat area in a given site.\nThis criterion looks at the same data as the diversity of natural habitats, categorized in broader natural habitat types (České republiky, 2025a). The map shows a prominence of grasslands outside of the city, but there are also forests, shrubs and peat bogs. The polygons of these natural habitats were divided based on grid lines using the ‘intersection’ tool, and then an ‘overlap analysis’ was conducted to identify the cover area of these combined natural habitats in each cell. The map shows that most of the natural habitats area actually concentrated further away from the stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Proportion of Natural Habitat Area Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Value\n&lt;0.4\n0.4-0.6\n&gt;0.6\nNormalized Range (0-1)\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nLow to No Presence\nSome Presence\nHigh Presence\nProportion of Natural Habitats per Cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion of Natural Habitat Area (normalized data).\n\n\nAreas With High Biodiversity Value\nThe three criteria for the sub-question are aggregated based on their weights and combined into an intermediate map which shows areas along the stream with high biodiversity value. Loučná nad Nisou, Hraničná and Tovární are the areas with the highest biodiversity value along Bílá Nisa.\n\n\n\nCombination Map Biodiversity Question 1: Areas With High Biodiversity Value.\n\n\n\n\nWhich Areas Have a High Level of Human Activity?\nThe presence of human activity is generally harms biodiversity, generally in the form of habitat destruction and lifestyle disturbance. Therefore areas where human activity is high may not be very effective locations to improve biodiversity.\nThis question has low weight compared to other questions. While a high level of human activity is undesirable for a biodiverse area, by all means it should not discourage efforts in trying to improve the ecological quality of a given location. The attributes considered in this question will be inverted for the final aggregation.\nWeighed Road Segment Length\nRoads act as physical barriers for wildlife, deterring animals from crossing, thereby fragmenting ecosystems, limiting migration and making them less resilient. Furthermore, even slow traffic roads increase the threat of bugs or animals being hit or run over by a car. Meanwhile diffuse pollution from tyre particles, gas leaks and window cleaning fluids threaten the health of ecosystems (Marcantioni, 2013).\nTherefore, this criterion looks at the existing road infrastructure and its speed limits, aiming to grasp the level of harm that vehicles and road infrastructure may cause to the biodiversity. The criterion looks at data of road length per cell, as well as its speed limit to estimate the impact that the roads would have on biodiversity in a given cell.\nThe road infrastructure was taken from OpenStreetMap and clipped to the grid (Open Street Map services, 2025d). The road segments were then ‘intersected’ according to the grid lines. The length of each road segment was multiplied by its speed limit to adjust for the impact that vehicle speeds would have on the biodiversity. Each line segment was then converted into a centroid, and the ‘join attributes by location (summary)’ function was used to find the sum of all of the given values within a cell. Then the data was normalized by dividing all values by the highest value. It is important to note that for the later aggregation, the values in this criterion had to be inverted, as a larger presence of roads is undesirable for biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Weighed Road Segment Length Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Value\n&lt;0.4\n0.4-0.6\n&gt;0.6\nNormalized Range (0-1)\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nLow to No Nuisance\nSome Nuisance\nHigh Nuisance\nRoad Nuisance by Proportion of Weighed Road Segment Length per Cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighed Road Segment Length (normalized data).\n\n\nProportion of Built-up Area\nUrbanization intensity negatively influences local biodiversity both directly and indirectly (Liu, 2025). Proportion of built-up area gives a clue of how intensely various parts of the study area are urbanized.\nThe build-up area criterion utilizes the data on existing buildings from Open Street Map services (2025a) to estimate the level of human activity in each cell. The ‘intersection’ function in QGIS split up the building polygons according to the grid lines. Afterwards, an ‘overlap analysis’ was conducted to calculate the percentage of area that is built-up within a given cell. In essence, the build-up area normalized value looks at the Floor Space Index (FSI) of each cell.\nThe results of the normalized data on build-up area show that there is some level of build-up along most parts of the stream. There is a fairly high variation of build-up area along the stream in the inner city. For the later aggregation, the values in this criterion had to be inverted, as it is undesirable for biodiversity to have a high level of build-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Proportion of Built-up Area Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Value\n&lt;40%\n40-60%\n&gt;60%\nNormalized Range (0%-100%)\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nLow to No Build-up\nSome Build-up\nHigh Build-up\nPercentage of Built-Up Area Per Cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion of Built-up Area (normalized data).\n\n\nAreas With High Level of Human Activity\nThe two criteria for the sub-question are aggregated based on their weights and combined into an intermediate map which shows areas along the stream with a high level of human activity. Industrial areas generally seem to have the highest level of human activity, namely the Janovská industrial site and the industrial area near Mšeno nad Nisou, along with the village of Janov nad Nisou.\n\n\n\nCombination Map Biodiversity Question 2: Areas With High Level of Human Activity.\n\n\n\n\nWhich Areas Provide Opportunity for Improved Biodiversity?\nAreas with certain existing spatial conditions may be easier to transform for improved biodiversity than others. Identifying these areas mean identifying locations which have the highest potential for improvement with minimum effort.\nEcological Corridors\nEcological corridors criterion looks at the defined ecological corridors to identify opportunities to not only improve the local biodiversity, but enhance the ecological network on the local, regional and inter-regional scale.\nThe data used for this criterion is the ‘Methodologically Unified Definition of The Territorial System of Ecological Stability’ from the Agency for Nature and Landscape Conservation of the Czech Republic (České republiky, 2025b). The dataset methodologically determined all hierarchial levels and types of territories which are vital for ecological stability.\nTo normalize this data, the layer polygons were split up per cell using the ‘intersect’ function, and the ‘overlap analysis’ was conducted to identify the percentage of area per cell that is taken up by the ecological corridor polygon. In the resulting map (where 1 is 100% of the area and 0 is 0% of the area) key cells for ecological connectivity can be seen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Ecological Corridors Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Value\n&lt;0.4\n0.4-0.6\n&gt;0.6\nNormalized Range (0-1)\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nLow to No Presence\nSome Presence\nHigh Presence\nProportion of Ecological Corridor Area Per Cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcological Corridors (normalized data).\n\n\nPotential for Natural Floodplain Restoration\nFor the natural floodplain restoration potential criterion, the ‘Categorization of Floodplains’ layer of the Agency for Nature and Landscape Conservation of the Czech Republic is used. As previously mentioned, the layer was developed as a practical decision-making tool to aid for the protection of significant landscape elements in the country by identifying their characteristics and value. Unfortunately, the source does not explicitly state the methodology of how these potentials were determined (České republiky, 2022).\nTo normalize this data, the polygons with medium and high potential for restoration were isolated. Since there are not many areas with floodplain restoration potential, and there is only one comparatively small patch of medium restoration potential, both medium and high potentials were considered as equal. The polygons were ‘intersected’ according to the grid lines, and then ‘overlay analysis’ was conducted to find the percentage of area with natural floodplain restoration for each cell. In the resulting map, key areas with higher potential for floodplain restoration can be seen both within and outside the city borders. As it is unclear what methodology was used to identify the potential, the weight of this criteria is moderate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Potential for Natural Floodplain Restoration Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Value\n&lt;0.4\n0.4-0.6\n&gt;0.6\nNormalized Range (0-1)\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nLow to No Presence\nSome Presence\nHigh Presence\nProportion of Area Per Cell With Potential for Natural Floodplain Restoration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential for Natural Floodplain Restoration (normalized data).\n\n\nZones of Protected Natural Areas\nLegal protection for natural areas is vital to limit human activity which may negatively influence biodiversity. However, establishing protected areas are often insufficient in preventing biodiversity loss. Therefore, the zones of protected natural areas are considered in this analysis but are given limited weight (Hein, 2024).\nZones of protection of natural areas examine the level of legal protection which large-scale specially protected natural areas have. The zoning data was taken from Agency for Nature and Landscape Conservation of the Czech Republic (České republiky, 2025d, 2025c). The dataset shows that there are some areas along the stream with Zone III and Zone IV levels of protection. Zone IV indicates a landscape management zone with the least strict protection, allowing for broader human activity, but still focusing on the preservation of ecological value. Zone III is a natural buffer zone where traditional and sustainable land use is still generally allowed. The map shows that mostly only the areas outside of the city borders have some level of protection.\nTo process the data, the polygons were ‘intercepted’ based on the grid lines, then the ‘overlap analysis’ function calculated the percentage of area different protection zones took up in each grid cell. Using the field calculator, the majority (&gt;50%) value in each cell size was identified and normalized. In case there was no majority, the average between two values with the highest percentage of area was taken. For example, if a cell was 45% zone III and 35% zone IV, then the final cell value is 0.5, because zone VI has the normalized value of 0.25 and zone III has the normalized value of 0.75.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Zones of Protected Natural Areas Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Value\n0\n0.25\n0.5\n0.75\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\nNo Protection\nLowest Protection Zone (VI)\nLow Protection Zone (VI/III)\nModerate Protection Zone (III)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZones of Protected Natural Areas (normalized data).\n\n\nAreas With Biodiversity Improvement Opportunities\nThe three criteria for the sub-question are aggregated based on their weights and combined into an intermediate map which shows areas along the stream with a potential for improved biodiversity. Compared to the other research sub-questions, areas with biodiversity opportunities have a more localized distribution. Key areas with biodiversity opportunities are the Loučná nad Nisou village, as well as the greenfield site near Hraničná. In the inner city, areas which offer biodiversity opportunities are: U Hřiště bridge, the industrial area near Mšeno nad Nisou and Tovární.\n\n\n\nCombination Map Biodiversity Question 3: Areas With Biodiversity Improvement Opportunities.\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity S-MCDA Aggregation & Conclusion\nHaving conducted the detailed analysis, all criteria values from the biodiversity are weighed and combined into a single concluding map:\n\n\n\nConcluding Biodiversity Map.\n\n\nThe concluding map offers insight to the initial biodiverisity research question: where can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?\nIn general, areas where ecological quality of the stream can be improved are situated outside of the most urbanized areas. Namely the area near Janovská highway, as well as the nearby village of Loučná nad Nisou seem to be the largest areas with the highest potential for ecological improvement. Inside the city of Jablonec nad Nisou, U Hřiště bridge and the industrial area near Mšeno nad Nisou offer the most potential for ecological improvement. Right at the city borders, areas of Hraničná and Tovární also offer possibilities for improved ecological quality.\n\n\n\n3.B. Climate Adaptation\nThe research area is currently dealing with increasing climate risks, particularly flood hazards, due to urban development. Therefore, the climate adaptation analysis aims to address the following question:\n\nWhere along the stream can flood mitigation measures take place?\n\nThis question is further divided into the following questions:\n\nWhich Areas Have Highest Flood Damage Risk?\n\n\nWhich Areas Have The Most Impervious Surfaces?\n\n\nWhich Areas Have Healthy Vegetation?\n\nThe figure below shows the criteria for each climate adaptation sub-question, along with the corresponding weights of each attribute. These weights are combined to determine the influence of each sub-question on the final result, with the total sum equal to one.\nBy aggregating these criteria, the analysis helps to spatially identify priority areas along the Bílá Nisa stream where climate adaptation measures such as flood management should be prioritized.\n\n\n\nAggregated Climate Adaptation Criteria.\n\n\n\nWhich Areas Have Highest Flood Damage Risk?\nFlood risk is one of the most urgent challenges in stream corridor management, especially in areas with extensive urbanization and altered natural floodplains. By locating these high-risk zones, planners can prioritize where flood mitigation strategies should be implemented first.\nFlood Impact Zones in Floodplains\nFloodplains are flat, low-lying areas near a river or coast that are likely to flood due to rainfall, tidal surges or other storm events. The type of landscaping in a floodplain can also reflect the level of flood impact risk. For example, a flood in an urbanized residential area will sustain much more damage compared to a flood in a natural area. The data used of this analysis comes from České republiky (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlood Impact Zones in Floodplains Normalisation Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\nLow Flood Risk (0)\nMiddle Flood Risk (0.5)\nHigh Flood Risk (1)\nNormalized Range (0-1)\n\n\n\n\nLandscape Type\nNatural forest / wetland\nArable land / grassland\nBuilt-up / paved surfaces\n0 – 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlood Impact Zones in Floodplains (normalized map).\n\n\n\n\nWhich Areas Have The Most Impervious Surfaces?\nA high proportion of impervious surfaces can directly lead to floods in urban areas, and contribute to the Urban Heat Island effect. Impervious surfaces directly affect the area’s ability to absorb water, while higher night land surface temperatures typically indicate denser built environments with less green cover.\nMean Impervious Surface Percentage\nImpervious surfaces, such as roads, rooftops, and paved areas, prevent water infiltration into the soil, leading to increased surface runoff, reduced groundwater recharge, and greater heat accumulation within urban environments. High levels of imperviousness are typically associated with poorer ecological performance, increased flood risks due to reduced infiltration capacity, and elevated urban heat island effects.\nFor these reasons, we applied normalization to this indicator using specific threshold ranges that reflect the relationship between imperviousness, ecological functioning, and environmental risks, ensuring the metric aligns with the ecological goals of our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpervious Surface Normalisation Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\nLow Risk Threshold (0)\nHigh Risk Threshold (1)\nNormalized Range (0–1)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nImpervious Surface (%)\n0%\n80%\n0 – 1\n&gt;80% often found in dense urban areas, 0% = natural cover. Therefore we normalise between this range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean Impervious Surface Percentage (Normalized Map).\n\n\nMean Night-Time Land Surface Temperature (LST)\nHigh night-time temperatures indicate poor cooling and urban heat retention. The Mean Night-Time Land Surface Temperature (LST) was collected from the Terra & Aqua satellite from NASA. The temporal range of when the data collected was the average LST from the summer of 2022 (june to august), this range was taken due to data availability. This data was chosen as the resolution was the highest at 1 by 1 km. Risk increases with rising LST, especially during summer heatwaves. The following table below shows the range of data collected compared to the normalized range.\nThe range we chose is adjusted to the context of the city. For that reason we choose to take the upper and lower bounds of the temperature and normalise between that range, as can be seen in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNight Time Land Surface Temperature Normalisation Table\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Mean LST table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\nLow Risk Threshold (0)\nHigh Risk Threshold (1)\nNormalized Range (0–1)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nMean Night-Time LST (°C)\n11°C\n16°C\n0 – 1\n30°C = common threshold for urban heat stress at night, we chose to normalise for our range. Given Jablonec is at altitude, the temperature is going to be lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean Night-Time Land Surface Temperature (Normalized Map).\n\n\n\n\nWhich Areas Have Healthy Vegetation?\nAreas with higher NDVI values suggest healthier and denser vegetation, which can contribute to climate resilience by reducing surface runoff and moderating urban heat effects.\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\nNDVI indicates vegetation health and coverage. The NDVI was collected from the Sentinel-2 satellite using bands 2, 3 and 8. Then the mean NDVI was computed based on a temporal range of the last 5 years(between 01-01-2020 and 01-01-2025), the resolution of final NDVI is 10 by 10m. Higher values correspond to greener, more vegetated areas, contributing to cooling and ecosystem benefits. An NDVI of &gt;0.6 is typical of healthy vegetation in temperate zones (Ozyavuz, 2015). For this reason the following table shows our justified choice of NDVI range when normalizing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalised Difference Vegetation Index Normalisation Table\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized NDVI Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\nLow Risk Threshold (0)\nHigh Risk Threshold (1)\nNormalized Range (0–1)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nNDVI\n0.6\n0.0\n0 – 1 (inverted)\nValues &gt;0.6 = dense vegetation; 0 = bare soil or built-up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (Normalized Map).\n\n\n\n\nClimate Adaptation S-MCDA Aggregation & Conclusion\nAccording to the criteria of the S-MCDA analysis, a concluding map was created to highlight areas along the Bílá Nisa Stream with lower overall adaptive capacity to climate change, where flood mitigation measures should take place.\nAll normalized data were extracted from the attribute tables and transferred into an Excel file, where weighted normalized values were calculated based on the criteria weights defined in the S-MCDA framework. These weighted values were then aggregated to produce a composite dataset reflecting the spatial distribution of flood risk. Notably, the NDVI values were inverted to align with the direction of other criteria — so that higher final scores indicate weaker flood resilience.\nThe resulting dataset was exported as a CSV file and linked to the grid layer in QGIS to visualize the spatial outcomes.The final concluding map is presented underneath\n\n\n\nConcluding climate adaptation S-MCDA Map\n\n\nThe final conclusding map reveals that two industrial sites along the stream exhibit particularly low adaptive capacity to flood risk, suggesting a pressing need for the implementation of resilience-based flood mitigation measures. Additionally, a sports field with impervious surfaces located between these two industrial areas was also identified as an area requiring improvement in surface permeability to enhance its flood adaptation performance.\n\n\n\n3.C. Quality of life\nFor quality of life, criteria can vary from psychological and health indicators to more tangible indicators on the conditions of the urban climate. František Murgaš & Michal Klobučník (Murgaš, 2016) used the gold standard for assessing quality of life in municipalities of the Czech Republic. They evaluated quality of life based on the following indicators below.\n\nWanting to live — can be expressed by the absence of the will to live, i.e., suicide. Expression of the indicator is suicide mortality rate.\n\n\nLong life — can be expressed by the indicator of life expectancy.\n\n\nLiving in a complete family - can be expressed by its absence; indicator is divorce rate. - Having children—can be expressed by the indicator of birth rate.\n\n\nBeing healthy — can be expressed by the absence of health; indicator is mortality.\n\n\nLiving in a healthy environment—can be expressed by the environmental pollution.\n\n\nBeing educated—can be expressed by the indicator of the share of university graduates.\n\n\nHaving a job — can be expressed by the indicator of unemployment rate.\n\n\nBeing a good person—can be expressed by the indicator of generativity.\n\nHowever, not all data used in this research are useful as it is mostly acquired through methods of fieldwork, like surveys and interviews, and are therefore perceived as subjective. Different indicators are required to determine how quality of life can be measured in urban space. Koi and Masanobu (Doi, 2008) discovered that accessiblity to basic human needs is an important factor for indicating quality of life and form a decisive criterion for planning for land use purposes or planning for new transportation infrastructure. Moreover, Khalil (Khalil, 2012) pointed out that economic viability of urban areas and the various forms of economic activity are also an important indicator for quality of life and the functioning of urban systems.\nBased on these 3 research papers, three different perspectives on quality of life performance of an urban area are constructed to implement in the research to assess the viability of the area around the urban stream; amenities around the stream, accessibility of the stream, and the condition of the urban climate. Based on the assignment to enhance the quality of life along the stream, one main research question and three sub research questions have been drafted to pin point the areas along the Bila Nisa that perform low and require an intervention to enhance the quality of life along the urban stream.\n\nWhich areas along the stream need improvements for quality of life to address stakeholder conflicts?\n\nThis question is further divided into the following questions:\n\nWhich Areas Are Deprived of Public Facilities?\n\n\nWhich Areas Lack Infrastructure to Access?\n\n\nWhich Areas Can Be Physically Uncomfortable?\n\nFollowing the research questions, a hierarchy is created to emphasize which aspects to quality of life are more important and require more priority over other criteria. In the S-MCDA diagram for quality of life, a distinction has been made between the three sub-topics, which are closely correlated to the briefing of the ReBioClim program.\n\n\n\nAggregated Quality of Life Criteria.\n\n\n\nWhich Areas Are Deprived of Public Facilities?\nPublic amenities are essential for urban life. Basic access to public goods such as parks and stores offer incentives to go out, socialize and improve the general well-being of the population. Therefore, mapping which areas have these amenities and highlighting the areas that are deprived and require better access for the sake of the population forms the first step to indicate which areas offer a better social climate. For the availability of public amenities along the stream, we looked at the availability of public green and the presence and diversity of public areas.\nAccess to Public Green Space\nAccessibility to nature and public green offer comfort in urban areas and is an important factor to be taken into account to determine if areas are liveable. As stated in the case of ReBioClim, ecological quality of the stream has been decreased over the years through human and industrial activity, resulting in a less livable urban environment. There are some public green areas along the stream mainly located on the outskirts of the urban area. The data used is derived from Open Street Map services (Open Street Map services, 2025b).\nA clip mask has been made to overlay it on the grid layer using the mean values. The area of public green per grid cell is then normalized on a 0 to 1 scale using the formula underneath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalisation Formula Access to Public Green Space\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized value = (“area mean” - min(“area mean”)) / (max(“area mean”) - min(“area mean”))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Public Green Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nLow availability (0-0.2)\nHigh availability (0.8-1)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nArea mean\n&lt;10073,8\n&gt;40295,2\n&lt;10073,8 → 0-0.2 (low availability), &gt;40295,2 → 0.8-1 (high availability)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the conversion to normalized values using the open field calculator tool in GIS, the layer has been styled using an equal interval of 5 classes.\n\n\n\nNormalized map of public green availability along Bila Nisa\n\n\nAccess to Public Amenities\nPublic amenities are needed to facilitate urban life and provide the population with basic human needs. Having these amenities close to the urban stream forms an important indicator how livable the environment around the Bila Nisa is. Using the land use and point of interest layers from Open Street Map services, a clip layer has been made to show all the public amenities and public areas surrounding the Bila Nisa (Open Street Map services, 2025c).\nThe layer filters only public areas that are also considered meeting spots for tacit encounters that could have a positive effect on the well-being of the population and create a sense of belonging. Based on these public amenities, data is normalized based on the diversity of public amenities, which indicates which area offer more public amenities and more social encounters in order to foster social life for the population of Jablonec nad Nisau.\nThe data is normalized using the layer count data, on a scale from 0 to 1. The formula underneath has been used in the open field calculator tool to create a new column with normalized values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalisation Formula for Access to Public Amenties\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized value = (“type count” - min(“type count”)) / (max(“type count”) - min(“type count”))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Public Amenities Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nLow availability (0-0.2)\nHigh availability (0.8-1)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nType count\n&lt;2\n&gt;5\n&lt;2 → 0-0.2 (low availability), &gt;5 → 0.8-1 (high availability)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing 5 classes, the layer is styled using an equal interval of 0.2. It shows two areas with high diversity, namely in the south downstream where different modes of infrastructure are located and more central near the Mšeno nad Nisou industrial area which is close to an urban center.\n\n\n\nNormalized map diversity of public amenities along Bila Nisa.\n\n\nCombining these two layers using the criteria weights in the S-MCDA, two areas stand out where the combination of public greenery and the diversity of amenities is high, which are the areas Tovarní-Síroka and Hraničná.\n\n\n\nCombined normalized layers availability of public goods.\n\n\n\n\nWhich Areas Lack Infrastructure to Access?\nThe second indicator for quality of life is the accessibility of the stream. The stream offers apart from a livable climate because of its cooling effect also a social haven for the population of Jablonec nad Nisau to meet in one of the leisure spots along the stream. Accessibility of the urban stream is analyzed through the existing road network and the public transport infrastructure.\nAccess to Stream\nHow well the urban stream can be accessed can be analyzed through the level of integration with the existing road network, which determines how central an area along the Bila Nisa is. For this analysis, the road network of Jablonec nad Nisau is extracted from Open Street Map services (Roads_OSM?) and a space syntax analysis is conducted using the Angular Integration tool to determine how central areas are based on the level of road integration. A clip mask focusing on the areas close to the Bila Nisa is made and overlapped on the grid.\nUsing the open field calculator, a new column is created for normalizing the data to a 0 to 1 scale using the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalisation Formula for Access to Stream\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized value = (“sum_Atw2kM” - minimum(“sum_Atw2kM”)) / (maximum(“sum_Atw2kM”) - minimum(“sum_Atw2kM”))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Road Integration Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nLow Integration (0)\nHigh Integration (1)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nAngular Integration Sum 2k\n&lt;41.25\n&gt;115.25\n&lt;41.25 → 0-0.25 (low integration), &gt;115.25 → 0.75-1 (high integration)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorizing the layer with the newly calculated normalized column, the following map shows how urban centers North, central and South-west of the stream can be defined.\n\n\n\nNormalized map showing accessiblity to urban stream.\n\n\nAccess to Public Transport\nApart from the road network, which primarily focuses on private mobility, public transport offers a good indication how the stream can be accessed from a more regional perspective For this, a data layer from the ArcGIS web (suchv_23398590_cuni, 2025) is found that represents the public transport network of Jablonec nad Nisau. A clip from this layer is made, which results in a couple of bus stops and a tram stops that fall within reach of the stream. To see how accessible the stream is from public transportation, service areas are used with a radius of 500m (bus stops) and 1000m (tram stops) based on the type of connection. Bus is considered as a more urban connection while the tram has a regional connection with the neighboring city of Liberec.\nBased on the number of opportunities, which is based on how many service areas overlap, the data can be normalized. A separate column is created using the open field calculator tool using the following formula to normalize the data from a 0 to 1 scale, based on the range of opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic transport access normalisation equation\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized value = (“layer count” - min(“layer count”)) / (max(“layer count”) - min(“layer count”))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Public transport proximity Table\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Public transport proximity Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nLow Access(0)\nHigh Access (1)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nLayer Count\n=0\n&gt;4\n&lt;1 → 0-0.2 (low access), &gt;4 → 1 (high access)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in the following map underneath, where areas in more urban areas in the south and on crossroads over better accessibility to public transport.\n\n\n\nAccess to public transport near the stream normalilzed.\n\n\nOverlaying these two layers, one can see a couple urban centers popping up. Especially in the south which is a more urban area and offer different modes of transport and regional connections. Furthermore, there is one main road along the stream connecting the city of Jablonec nad Nisau with rural villages like Loucná nad Nisau. However, the map shows that more central areas with leisure are not well connected.\n\n\n\nCombined accessibility map.\n\n\n\n\nWhich Areas Can Be Physically Uncomfortable?\nThe last performance indicator for quality of life relates to physical condition of the urban environment, in other words to figure out how healthy the urban environment around the Bila Nisa is. This is relevant for the case of Jablonec nad Nisau since the area was once a breeding ground for industrial activity, especially for glass and glass ornament production (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2011).\nAir Pollution\nTo ensure comparability across pollutants, all air quality indicators were normalized to a common scale between 0 and 1. The normalization is based on internationally recognized health guidelines from the World Health Organization (Organization, 2021) and the European Union (Directive 2008/50/EC) (COmmission, 2023). For PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, and NO₂, thresholds were defined using three reference points: half the WHO annual guideline value (representing minimal health risk), the WHO annual guideline value (health-based target), and the EU legal limit (regulatory maximum). For SO₂, BaP, and BzN, thresholds were determined using available EU targets or inspired by the Belgian national limits (IRCELINE, 2022). All values were normalized using the upper bound of each category range to reflect worst case exposure levels for each grid cell. This approach allows consistent interpretation of long-term exposure risks across pollutants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Air Pollution Normalisation Method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPollutant\nWHO 2021 Guideline (µg/m³)\nEU Limit (µg/m³)\nLow Risk Threshold (0) = ½ WHO\nHigh Risk Threshold (1) = EU\nNormalized Range (0–1)\n\n\n\n\nPM2.5\n5\n20\n2.5\n20\n0 – 1\n\n\nPM10\n15\n40\n7.5\n40\n0 – 1\n\n\nNO₂\n10\n40\n5\n40\n0 – 1\n\n\nBaP\n0.12 (indicative, EU)\n1.0\n0.06\n1.0\n0 – 1\n\n\nBzN\n0.2 (WHO guideline)\n1.0 (assumed)\n0.1\n1.0\n0 – 1\n\n\nSO₂\n40 (WHO 24h guideline)\n125 (EU 24h)\n20\n125\n0 – 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA then example calculation in Qgis for SO2 would be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculation Example for SO2\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE WHEN “MAX_majority” IS NULL THEN NULL WHEN “MAX_majority” &lt; 20 THEN 0 WHEN “MAX_majority” &gt; 125 THEN 1 ELSE (“MAX_majority” - 20) / (125 - 20) END\n\n\n\nHowever, as was later discovered, this approach led to all of the pollution data being qualified as 0. Given the Czech data is categorized differently and is given as aggregated annual values, a choice was made to use the same range given with the data (and its associated colours) when normalizing. Given that our analysis is context specific, changing the normalization will highlight the range in air quality within our given site. Whether the air quality is below or above the recommended values will no longer become the basis.\nThis simpler method yields the final table with the new normalization based on the input data classification is the following.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Normalisation Method for Pollution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPollutant\nObserved Max (From Layer)\nLow Risk Threshold (0)\nHigh Risk Threshold (1)\nNormalization Formula\n\n\n\n\nPM2.5\n2.5\n0\n5\n\"Max Grid Pollution Value\" / 2.5\n\n\nSO₂\n2.5\n0\n5\n\"Max Grid Pollution Value\" / 2.5\n\n\nBaP\n0.16\n0\n0.16\n\"Max Grid Pollution Value\" / 0.16\n\n\nPM10\n3\n0\n3\n\"Max Grid Pollution Value\" / 3\n\n\nNO₂\n3.5\n0\n3.5\n\"Max Grid Pollution Value\" / 3.5\n\n\nBzN\n0.25\n0\n0.25\n\"Max Grid Pollution Value\" / 0.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Tree Cover\nTree cover density represents the percentage of land surface covered by trees within our chosen area of interest. This measure is normalized on a 0 to 1 scale, where 0 corresponds to &lt;25% tree cover and 1 corresponds to &gt;75% tree cover. This range was chose as lower tree cover densities (&lt;0.25) are linked to increased land surface temperatures and higher urban heat island effects, while higher densities (&gt;0.75) are associated with reduced temperatures and mitigation of urban heat (Morabito, 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalisation for Tree Cover Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nLow Risk Threshold(0)\nHigh Risk Threshold (1)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nTree Canopy Cover\n&gt;75%\n&lt;25%\n75% → 0 (low risk), 25% → 1 (high risk)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalised Mean Tree Cover Percentage (Normalized Map).\n\n\nCombining these two layers results in the following combined map. The map shows the more urban one goes, the less liveable the urban climate becomes. Some areas score low because they are former and current industrial areas, for example Hranicá and Janovska industrial areas were pollution is still present.\n\n\n\nUrban life conditions along the Stream (Normalized Map).\n\n\n\n\nQuality of Life S-MCDA Aggregation & Conclusion\nUsing the criteria of the S-MCDA analysis, a combined map is created to highlight which areas along the Bila Nisa stream perform less on quality of life, and suggest an intervention is required to enhance quality of life performance along the urban stream.\nAll the normalized data is extracted from the attribute table and transferred to an Excel file to calculate the normalized values against the criteria weights from the S-MCDA. All the weighted values are combine in order to create and prepare the aggregated data set for quality of life. Only for the criteria air pollution, the data is inverted as a higher score, means higher the air pollution, which is a negative indicator for urban life condition. The data is then exported as a CSV file in QGIS and the aggregated values are joined in the combined grid layer. The final combined map is presented underneath.\n\n\n\nCombined & Weighed Quality of Life Map.\n\n\nThe combined map shows that more remote areas along main roads Tovarní-Síroka and in the village Loucná nad Nisau, and former industrial areas Hranicná, Janovska, and Mseno nad Nisau show lower quality of life performance. The more remote areas should improve public amenities while the industrial areas need more ecological improvement.\n\n\n\n3.D. S-MCDA Conclusion\nHaving conducted S-MCDA , it is now possible to answer the main research questions:\n\nBiodiversity: Where can the ecological quality of the stream area be enhanced?\n\nEcological quality along the stream can mainly be improved in the outskirts and outside of the city. However, some locations in the inner city, such as the area near U Hřiště bridge and Tovární.\n\nClimate Adaptation: Where along the stream can flood mitigation measures take place?\n\nFlood mitigation measures can be implemented mainly in the inner city, particularly in the industrial area near Mšeno nad Nisou and the sports field near U Hřiště bridge.\n\nQuality of Life: Which areas along the stream need improvements for quality of life to address stakeholder conflicts?\n\nFor this question, the research looked at areas which are lacking social infrastructure and accessibility for a good quality of life. Therefore areas which are in need of improvements are those which are currently performing poorly. Quality of life differs somewhat evenly across the entire length of the stream. There is not a significant difference between the inner city and its outskirts. Inside the city, key areas which are in need of quality of life improvements are Tovární - Siroká, the industrial area near Mšeno nad Nisou and the Janovská industrial area.\n\n\n\nConcluding S-MCDA Maps."

    "section": "4. Typology Construction",
    "text": "4. Typology Construction\nTypology construction is an important step in our analysis as it allows us to transform normalized spatial indicator data into clusters based on their characteristics. From these groups, we can derive insights and identify suitable interventions for each area. Along the Bila Nisa stream, spatial conditions vary greatly, as shown in our previous MCDA analysis maps. These variations in ecological quality, flood risk, and human accessibility create challenges when designing targeted interventions and prioritizing areas for action. Without organizing our grid into meaningful clusters, it becomes much more difficult to identify where specific solutions would be most effective or necessary.\nTypologies help simplify this complexity by grouping similar areas together, making it possible to prioritize where to preserve, restore, or enhance green-blue infrastructure in a targeted and informed manner. This approach also supports communication with stakeholders by providing a structured, evidence-based narrative that connects spatial data with planning decisions. In this way, typology becomes a bridge between spatial analysis and actionable green-blue infrastructure strategies.\nThe approach we took in this report to constructing our topologies is embedded in our main research questions and goals. Based on our analysis we formulated the following guiding question for finding relevant typologies in Jablonec nad Nisou.\n\n4.a. Research Question & Variables\n\n“What spatial typologies emerge from key ecological and accessibility indicators along the stream corridor, and how can they inform targeted green-blue infrastructure interventions?”\n\nThis question is grounded in the broader ambition to enhance ecosystem services, urban climate resilience, and quality of life through the strategic planning of nature-based solutions. To approach this, we identified from all of our indicators, 4 main key spatial indicators that reflect the functionality of green-blue spaces. Each indicator was selected to represent a dimension of performance relevant to our project:\nProportion of Natural Habitat (Biodiversity): A higher share of natural habitat suggests greater ecological quality and potential for species support and connectivity.\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Climate Adaptation): NDVI serves as a proxy for vegetative health and biomass, contributing to climate regulation, shading, and evapotranspiration.\nFlood Impact Zones in Floodplains (Climate Adaptation): Areas exposed to flood risk offer opportunities for flood-resilient design, such as for example wetland restoration or floodable parks.\nAccess to Stream (Quality of Life): Stream accessibility reflects the potential for recreation, well-being, and nature connection for residents, which at the moment due to stakeholder conflicts may be lacking.\nBy combining these indicators, we aim to capture both the ecological aspects and human functionality of areas along the stream. This will enable us to cluster similar grid cells into meaningful typologies relevant to our research. We believe that the typologies will support decision making for where to preserver, intervene or enhance the multifunctional green-blue spaces along the Bila Nisa stream.\n\n\n4.b. Methodology\nStep 1: Data Preparation and Normalization\nTo begin, we extracted the four selected indicators from our spatial dataset and removed the geometry to focus on their numerical values. Since K-means is sensitive to scale, we standardized the data using z-score normalization. This rescales each variable so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, ensuring that all variables contribute equally to the clustering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Choosing the Number of Clusters (Elbow Method)\nThe K-means algorithm requires specifying the number of clusters k. To find a suitable value, we used the elbow method, which involves:\n\nRunning K-means for a range of k values (2 to 9).\nCalculating inertia for each value — the total within-cluster sum of squares. Lower inertia means tighter, more compact clusters.\n\nWe then plotted the inertia values to identify the “elbow point”, where the reduction in inertia begins to level off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the elbow plot, we choose k = 5 as a good number of clusters.\nStep 3: Running the K-means Algorithm\nBased on step 2, we set a fixed seed to ensure reproducibility and ran the K-means algorithm using k = 5. Each grid cell was assigned a cluster label. This will then allow us to perform the next step, where we can visualize the clusters in their respective grid cells.\nStep 4: Visualizing Clusters\nAs mentioned, now that we have performed the K means clustering with a value of 5, we can explored the distribution of clusters both spatially and in feature space.\n\n2D Map: Shows how clusters are arranged geographically.\n3D Plot: Visualizes how clusters are separated in terms of indicator values (3 axes: NDVI, natural habitat, access).\n\nWe chose these 3 axis after trial and error with the fourth indicator (Flood Impact Zones). The combination below resulted in a better visual of how the clusters formed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Understanding Cluster Profiles (Radar Charts)\nTo interpret the clusters, we examined the cluster centers, which represent the “average” values of each indicator per cluster.\nWe converted the standardized cluster centers back to the original scale to understand their real-world meaning and visualized them using radar charts, highlighting each cluster’s performance across the four indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Assessing Cluster Confidence (Distance to Cluster Center)\nWe calculated the Euclidean distance from each grid cell to its assigned cluster center in feature space. This indicates how representative a cell is of its cluster: smaller distances imply stronger conformity.\nThis was visualized using histograms, one per cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.c. Results\nTypology description\nThe result of performing K-means clustering to derive typologies is the translation from statistical output into actionable insights. For this reason, we have tried to describe the formed clusters appropriately based on their characteristics, theory and literature to guide intervention planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType (Cluster)\nNatural Habitat\nNDVI\nFlood Zone\nStream Access\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1 (Red)\nHigh\nHigh\nLow\nLow\nThis cluster represents areas with lush, biodiverse vegetation and high ecological quality. These zones have low flood risk but are relatively inaccessible to the public.

This approach helps us understand the “typical” spatial characteristics of each typology by looking directly at the physical environment in satellite view.\nViewing these tiles alongside our typology tables allows us to connect normalized indicator data with what these areas actually look like on the ground. We can then also provide visual confirmation that should align with the typology’s data profile and description.\nBy repeating this visual process across all five of the clusters closest to their respective centers, we can compare the difference in vegetation density, built-up areas, stream access paths, and floodplain conditions, allowing for a more intuitive interpretation of each typology.\nIn this way, visualizing the tiles bridges quantitative clustering with qualitative site reading, strengthening the practical relevance of the typology construction for planning the targeted interventions along the Bila Nisa stream."

    "text": "5. Discussion\nThe methodology used in this analysis combines multiple spatial vector and raster datasets and a structured decision-making approach (S-MCDA) to support urban and environmental planning. This process allowed for an assessment by including both environmental and social indicators.\nData Availability. While some datasets, like biodiversity, provided detailed information, others, such as air quality, were more general. The difference in level of detail are not ideal for this kind of analysis, as it may distort the results by missing important local spatial conditions. Unfortunately due to limited data availability, the analysis had to utilize a variety of data types with varying levels of detail.\n100 meter buffer limitation. The choice of a 100-meter buffer around the Bílá Nisa stream focused on the study area and excluded any information outside of it. This may have left out some important factors just outside of the buffer zone, thus reducing the accuracy of the results. A larger or adjustable buffer could have added more important context, but it would also variability and make it harder to ensure that data is comparable.\nVarying grid size. One key aspect of the methodology was the use of different grid cell sizes 50x50 meters in urban areas and 100x100 meters in rural areas. This approach helped to show more detail in the urban environments, where it is needed. However, using two different grid sizes also introduced some challenges and limitations. The difference in cell sizes restricted the possible spatial analysis methods to calculating density and percentage of cover area. While accounting for the differing grid cell sizes, the selected methods of analysis may have still skewed the results, as 100x100 meter cells averaged out differing values on a larger scale than the 50x50 meter cells. This made it harder to compare certain results across the whole study area.\nGrid positioning. The positioning of the grid itself also played a role in the final results. Even small changes in where the grid is placed can affect the outcome, as the grid isolates whole spatial units from each other based on the grid lines. It is possible that if the grid was overlayed with a different reference point, the results would identify different problem areas. Therefore, placement still matters and should be considered when interpreting the results.\nStatic information. The analysis was based on static data, meaning it represents conditions at one point in time. However, urban and environmental factors often change with years and seasons, as the area develops and the climate conditions change. A key limitation of this research is that it does not account for this possible variability. For example, the accessibility to the stream may be drastically different in the summer and winter. This variation is especially important to consider for planning resilient, flexible and long-lasting stream restoration projects.\nTypology Construction Another important observation relates to the interpretation of typologies based on the K-means clustering approach. The nearest grid cell to the cluster center in feature space, which we often use as an illustrative example of a “typical” cell, may not necessarily be representational of the spatial or contextual characteristics of the entire typology in reality. This is exhibited when visualizing our five nearest grid cells respective to their cluster centers. Some appear quite similar, and the size and shape of the spatial unit may lead to unrealistic representation of the cluster. Local variations, edge effects, and mixed land uses can cause certain grid cells to exhibit high conformity in indicator values while not fully reflecting the actual on the ground conditions. This means that while the clustering helps identify patterns and priority areas, local field verification and expertise remain essential before planning interventions. Additionally, the typology maps, while helpful for visualizing patterns, should be used in conjunction with stakeholder input to interpret what the clusters mean in practice, especially in areas where social conflicts over stream access may exist.\nFurthermore, it is important to note that not all of the five tiles closest to the cluster centers contain the stream corridor within them. This occurs because the selection was based on proximity to the cluster center in normalized feature space, not physical location along the stream. As a result, some tiles, despite being statistically representative of their typology, may not fully reflect the spatial relationship with the stream that is central to the project’s intervention focus. This is a limitation when interpreting typologies for green-blue infrastructure planning, as it may overlook the spatial dynamics of hydrological connectivity and riparian accessibility that are critical for targeted interventions.\nTo address this, these representative tiles should be interpreted as indicator archetypes rather than direct site candidates, and planners should cross reference these typologies with spatial layers showing actual stream locations for planning interventions. Future analyses could consider constraining cluster sampling to cells intersecting the stream to align more closely with hydrological connectivity goals while maintaining typology interpretability.\nThese cells, however, can also reveal a different and valuable perspective. Although some do not intersect directly with the stream, they highlight areas slightly further away that may still require intervention and can play a crucial role in connecting people to the stream corridor. In this sense, a more top down perspective on restoration in Jablonec nad Nisou recognizes that enhancing areas adjacent to, but not directly intersecting, the Bila Nisa may be just as important as interventions within the immediate riparian zone. Such areas can serve as green stepping stones, improving access, ecological connectivity, and the overall experience of the stream corridor for residents while contributing to the broader goals of urban climate resilience and quality of life.\nLastly, the selection of four key indicators, while aligned with the project’s goals, inherently leaves out other dimensions such as soil quality, microclimate, and informal community uses that may affect the success of interventions. Future work could explore adding more dynamic or seasonal variables or using ensemble clustering methods to test the stability of typologies under varying indicators.\n\nGroup Reflection\nAs a group, it was challenging to keep our work coordinated so that it is comparable and consistent across themes and analyses. At these moments, it was very helpful to have the Miro board, as it helped us to keep track of our tasks and progress, as well as to add notes. While GitHub and RStudio also offered a medium for group collaboration, our lack of mastery in these programs was often a big obstacle to overcome. Overall the our troubles with coordination and limited software skills resulted in a workflow which is not entirely consistent, making the results of the analysis less reliable than they could have been.\nOur challenge with the workflow was that it is linear, which means that if there is an inconsistency in a calculation a few steps back, all of those steps have to be redone. As a group, it was easy to miss those mistakes and then it would take a long time to fix them. A lot of backtracking could have been avoided if we had better documentation and communication in the workflow. Nevertheless, S-MCDA was a valuable analytic approach to learn, as it provides great opportunities for systemic and rigorous analyses which include multiple goals and attributes."

    "text": "6. Conclusion\nThe analysis of the Bílá Nisa stream using Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA) and typology construction visualized places where interventions are necessary along the stream in Jablonec nad Nisou. The findings show that different parts of the stream area vary significantly in terms of biodiversity value, climate vulnerability, and quality of life indicators.\nThe inner-city sections of the stream present the greatest need for intervention. These areas are heavily urbanized, with limited vegetation, poor access to the stream and have degraded environmental conditions. At the same time, they offer high potential for integrated improvements in biodiversity, climate adaptation, and public well-being. Targeted actions in these zones such as adding green-blue infrastructure, restoring ecological connections, and improving accessibility could create meaningful benefits for both people and nature.\nOn the other hand, areas in the north of Jablonec nad Nisou which have high ecological value and lower human pressure, should be primarily preserved and improved without disturbing existing natural functions. These zones play an important role in maintaining biodiversity and supporting long-term ecological stability.\nWhile the typology construction and clustering provided actionable insights, it is important to emphasize that these are analytical abstractions that should be interpreted with care. The clusters represent simplifications of complex socio-ecological realities, and the identified priority zones are starting points for planning rather than definitive boundaries for interventions. The methodology offers a replicable workflow for other urban streams, but it should be paired with other forms of validation and assessment. Such an approach would strengthen our research and approach towards the ReBioClim case study while recognizing the limitations of spatial clustering for typology construction in heterogeneous urban landscapes.\nIn summary, the combination S-MCDA and k-means clustering. The results introduce another facet from which local authorities, urban designers, and environmental planners can be guided in developing actions that balance ecological needs with urban development. This work contributes to the goals of the ReBioClim framework by highlighting where multifunctional green-blue infrastructure can improve biodiversity, climate adaptation and quality of life in the city."
